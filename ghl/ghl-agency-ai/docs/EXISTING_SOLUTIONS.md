## Recommendation

**Use Claude-Flow as reference architecture** because:

1. **Most comprehensive**: 100+ tools, 25 skills, full orchestration
2. **Production-ready**: 10.6k stars, active community
3. **Modern tech stack**: TypeScript, Docker, WebSocket, MCP
4. **Enterprise features**: Swarm intelligence, persistent memory, vector search
5. **Well-documented**: Extensive docs and examples
6. **Active development**: Regular updates and bug fixes

## Our Approach

Instead of building from scratch, we should:

1. **Study Claude-Flow architecture** for best practices
2. **Adopt similar patterns**: Agent loop, tool framework, memory system
3. **Simplify for learning**: Focus on core features first
4. **Add our own innovations**: Better UI/UX, mobile-responsive design
5. **Create educational version**: Well-commented, easy to understand

## Key Learnings from Claude-Flow

### Architecture Patterns
- **Swarm coordination**: Multiple agents working together
- **Persistent memory**: SQLite for state management
- **Semantic search**: Vector embeddings for intelligent retrieval
- **Hook system**: Pre/post operation automation
- **MCP integration**: Standard protocol for tool calling

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better DX
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, embedded database
- **Docker**: Containerization for isolation
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication
- **Express.js**: Simple, proven backend framework

### Tool Framework Design
- **Declarative definitions**: JSON schema for tools
- **Automatic activation**: Natural language triggers
- **Graceful fallback**: Hybrid mode for compatibility
- **Performance optimization**: Caching, indexing, quantization
