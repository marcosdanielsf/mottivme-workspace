## Integration Steps (To Do)

### Step 1: Add Provider to App
- [ ] Import NotificationProvider
- [ ] Wrap app root component
- [ ] Ensure Sonner Toaster is present

### Step 2: Add NotificationCenter to UI
- [ ] Import NotificationCenter
- [ ] Add to header/navbar
- [ ] Position appropriately

### Step 3: Test Basic Functionality
- [ ] Trigger test notification
- [ ] Verify toast appears
- [ ] Verify sound plays (if enabled)
- [ ] Check badge count updates
- [ ] Open notification center
- [ ] Mark notification as read
- [ ] Verify persistence across refresh

### Step 4: Test SSE Integration
- [ ] Start agent task
- [ ] Verify notifications from agent logs
- [ ] Check notification types match log levels
- [ ] Verify metadata is included

### Step 5: Run Tests
- [ ] Run: `npm test -- notifications`
- [ ] Verify all 33 tests pass
- [ ] Check test coverage

### Step 6: Customize (Optional)
- [ ] Adjust colors to match theme
- [ ] Customize sound preferences
- [ ] Modify grouping window
- [ ] Update max notifications limit
- [ ] Add custom notification types

## Verification Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Create success notification → Toast appears, sound plays
- [ ] Create error notification → Red toast, error sound
- [ ] Create warning notification → Amber toast, warning sound
- [ ] Create info notification → Blue toast, info sound
- [ ] Create agent-update → Purple toast, agent sound
- [ ] Click bell icon → Dialog opens
- [ ] Badge shows correct unread count
- [ ] Click notification → Marks as read, badge decrements
- [ ] Mark all as read → All notifications read, badge = 0
- [ ] Remove notification → Removed from list
- [ ] Clear all → All removed
- [ ] Refresh page → Unread notifications persist
- [ ] Toggle sound → Sound on/off works
- [ ] Toggle grouping → Grouping on/off works
- [ ] Similar notifications group correctly

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Tab to bell icon → Focuses
- [ ] Enter/Space → Opens dialog
- [ ] Tab through notifications → All focusable
- [ ] Enter/Space on notification → Marks as read
- [ ] Escape → Closes dialog
- [ ] Screen reader announces notifications
- [ ] ARIA labels present
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome → All features work
- [ ] Firefox → All features work
- [ ] Safari → All features work (sound after interaction)
- [ ] Edge → All features work
- [ ] Mobile Safari → Works
- [ ] Mobile Chrome → Works

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Add 100 notifications → No lag
- [ ] Max notifications enforced
- [ ] localStorage size reasonable
- [ ] Re-renders efficient
- [ ] Sounds don't overlap

### Error Handling
- [ ] localStorage full → Handles gracefully
- [ ] Invalid JSON in localStorage → Recovers
- [ ] No AudioContext → Works without sound
- [ ] SSE disconnected → Notifications still work
- [ ] Provider unmounted → No memory leaks

## Known Limitations

1. **Web Audio API**: Requires user interaction in Safari before sounds work
2. **localStorage**: 5-10MB limit across entire domain
3. **Grouping**: Only within 1-minute window
4. **No server persistence**: Notifications only in browser
5. **No push notifications**: Requires service worker (future)

## Next Steps After Integration

1. **Monitor usage**: Track notification engagement
2. **Gather feedback**: User preferences and pain points
3. **Optimize sounds**: Adjust tones based on feedback
4. **Add analytics**: Track notification types and read rates
5. **Extend types**: Add custom notification types as needed
6. **i18n support**: Add multi-language notifications
7. **Push notifications**: Implement service worker for push
