## 📖 Legacy Page - Premium Storytelling

### Legacy Section Design (Clean, Scroll-Triggered)

**Hero:**
```
"The MetroFlex Legacy"
40 Years. 8x Mr. Olympia. 2x Arnold Classic. Hundreds of Champions.
```

**Story Arc (Russell Brunson Hook-Story-Offer):**

#### HOOK
```
1987. Corporate gyms are taking over.
Real iron culture is dying.
One man refuses to conform.
```

#### STORY

**Chapter 1: The Beginning (1987)**
```
Brian Dobson opens MetroFlex Gym in Arlington, Texas.
No fancy machines. No family fitness vibes.
Just heavy iron, hard work, and a champion-making vision.

"Build it, and they will come."
They did.
```

**Chapter 2: The Moment That Changed Everything (1990)**
```
A police officer named Ronnie Coleman walks through the door.
Brian Dobson sees potential. Offers him a deal:
"Let me train you for Mr. Texas. Win, and you train here free for life."

Ronnie agrees.

He doesn't just win Mr. Texas.
He wins 8x Mr. Olympia.
The greatest bodybuilder of all time.
Trained at MetroFlex.
```

**Chapter 3: The Champion Factory (1990-2025)**
```
Ronnie Coleman - 8x Mr. Olympia
Branch Warren - 2x Arnold Classic Champion
Johnnie Jackson - Elite Pro Bodybuilder
300+ NPC Pro Cards Earned
Hundreds of National Qualifiers

The gym becomes legendary.
Museums preserve its history.
Champions travel from across the world to train here.
```

**Chapter 4: MetroFlex Events is Born**
```
From the iron that forged legends comes something new:
MetroFlex Events - Premier NPC Competition Organizer

We bring 40 years of champion-making experience to every show.
Professional judging. Championship atmosphere. Legacy standards.

Because you don't prep for months to compete at "just another show."
You compete where it matters.
At a MetroFlex Event.
```

#### OFFER
```

✓ National Qualifier Status (fastest path to Pro Card)

## 📱 Parallax Effects (Recommendation)

### Subtle Parallax (Recommended)

**Sections with parallax:**
1. **Hero background** - Moves slower than content (0.5x speed)
2. **Event cards** - Slight depth effect on scroll
3. **Stats numbers** - Count up when scrolled into view
4. **Legacy section background** - Slow parallax gradient

**Implementation:**
- Lightweight JavaScript (no libraries needed)
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Mobile-optimized (reduced effects on small screens)
- Reduced motion support (respects accessibility)

**Effect:**
- Adds depth and premium feel
- Not distracting or heavy
- Enhances storytelling

---

## 🎯 Brand Positioning - "Not Just Another Event"

### Differentiation Messaging

**Everywhere this appears:**

- Meta description

**Variations:**
- "Not just another event, a MetroFlex event"
- "MetroFlex Championship Series - Where it matters"

- "40 years of champion-making pedigree"

### Visual Differentiation

**Design elements that reinforce "premium":**
- ✅ Dark industrial theme (vs. bright generic templates)
