Pre-purchasing online saves $5-10 per ticket versus buying at the door. VIP packages with meet & greet opportunities (including photo ops with Ronnie Coleman) range from $100-250. Children under 12 typically receive 50% discount."

                    <h3>You've Put in the Work. Now Step Into a Legacy.</h3>
                    <p>
                        You've been training for months. Maybe years. Early mornings. Late nights. Sacrificing when others quit.
                        You've earned the right to compete. <strong>And you deserve a stage that honors that dedication.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you step on a MetroFlex stage, you're connecting to a champion-making legacy that started in 1987.
                        The same facility where a police officer named Ronnie Coleman walked in and trained to become
                        <strong>8x Mr. Olympia</strong>, the greatest bodybuilder of all time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MetroFlex Events brings that same championship DNA to every NPC competition we organize. The standards
                        that built legends. The respect for the sport. The atmosphere where champions are made. Premier venues.
                        Professional organization. A platform where your hard work is celebrated and your potential is recognized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You're not just entering a show. You're joining the ranks of champions who have walked this path before you. Athletes
                        who pushed their limits, showcased their dedication, and left everything on stage. That's the MetroFlex way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="legacy-cta-text">
