Every business owner has a mistake that they will never forget. The genius marketing campaign that you were for sure thought was going to work, or that new product that you came out with and you're like, everyone's going to eat this up, and no one bought it. That new hire that you brought in and you're like, oh, this person's definitely going to work out, and they flop. But here's the thing about $4,972 mistakes. They're actually cheap compared to $50,000 mistakes, which I can tell you that I've made, or $500,000 mistakes, which unfortunately I have also made, or the might bankrupt my company mistake, which I've made two times which hurt a lot. But the funny thing is, those mistakes aren't even original. They're the same mistakes that thousands of other business owners made before you. What we try and do is help recognize those blind spots, dodge the common mistakes, and while we can't promise that we're going to fix the business, maybe we can help you scale it with fewer scars. And so this is two days at my headquarters to a hands-on workshop with me and my team, the actual portfolio team that grows my companies. And we'll share with you the things that we did to break through each level and then help apply it to your business. And so if that sounds interesting, you can click the link, you can book a call, and we'd love to meet you.

I do Standing Bird Dog, not on all fours, so I can walk without feeling wobbly. I do Standing Leg Extensions. No getting down here, so my knees feel good when going down the stairs. I do Standing Knee Lifts, not on the floor, so I can strengthen my hips without ever getting down. The truth is, most fitness and therapy programs expect getting down on the floor.

Scrapes AI - Simon's Voice,"# Advertising / Sales Copy Framework

## Overview
This framework applies 12 proven copywriting rules specifically for AI automation services, targeting business owners who want to save time and aspiring entrepreneurs who want to sell automation services. All examples maintain a practical, no-nonsense tone without hype or exaggeration.

---

## Rule 1: Headlines Come First for a Reason
**Principle:** Your headline determines if people read anything else. It's 80% of your advertising effectiveness.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Headlines:**
- ""Built a System That Handles 15,000 Orders. Here's How.""
- ""The Exact Templates We Used at Dishpatch (Now Yours)""
- ""From Manual Chaos to Automated Calm: A Practical Guide""

**Conversion Page Headlines:**
- ""From Zero to First Automation in 7 Days - Even If YouTube Tutorials Left You Confused""
- ""Stop Watching Random Tutorials. Start Building Real Business Systems.""
- ""Copy-Paste Templates That Actually Work (Because We Built Them for Real Clients)""

**About Page Headlines:**
- ""From 100 to 15,000 Deliveries: Why I'm Obsessed with Systems That Scale""
- ""I've Taught 100,000+ People, But the Systems Still Have to Work""

---

## Rule 2: Say What Only You Can Say
**Principle:** Your unique proof can't be copied by competitors.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""100,000+ people have learned automation from my content. 26k YouTube subscribers. 4.6/5 on Udemy. I focus entirely on teaching now because that's where I make the biggest impact - helping others build what took me years to figure out.""

**Conversion Page:**
""After scaling a startup from 100 to 15,000 deliveries per month, I learned what systems actually need to work at scale. Now I teach those exact methods - no client work, no distractions, just focused on helping you build automations that don't break.""

**About Page:**
""Mechanical engineer turned operations lead turned teacher. I've been through the full journey - building systems, scaling them, and now teaching others to do the same. My Upwork days taught me what businesses actually need. Now you get those lessons without the trial and error.""

---

## Rule 3: Always Call Out Who You're Looking For (And Who You're Not)
**Principle:** Polarize to magnetize the right people.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""This is for business owners drowning in manual tasks OR aspiring automation consultants ready to charge $2-5k per system. NOT for people looking for get-rich-quick schemes or 'passive income' fantasies.""

**Conversion Page:**
""Perfect if you:
- Spend 10+ hours weekly on repetitive tasks
- Have watched YouTube tutorials but can't connect the dots
- Want to build real systems, not play with ChatGPT prompts

Skip this if you:
- Need results tomorrow (good systems take 7-14 days)
- Want to automate without learning the basics
- Think AI will magically fix a broken business""

**About Page:**
""I work with two types of people: Business owners who know their time is worth more than $50/hour, and future automation consultants who want to build $5k systems, not $50 Fiverr gigs.""

---

## Rule 4: Always Have a Reason Why
**Principle:** People need a ""because"" - even a simple one increases action.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""Launching new templates this month because three members asked for the same system last week. When patterns emerge, we build solutions.""

**Conversion Page:**
""Why copy-paste templates? Because after 350+ hours on Upwork, I noticed everyone was building the same 12 automations. So I documented them perfectly. Once.""

**Email:**
""Running this workshop because January is when businesses set their efficiency goals. Perfect timing to show you what's possible.""

---

## Rule 5: Damaging Admissions
**Principle:** Admit flaws to gain trust, then pivot to strengths.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""I haven't built million-dollar agencies or sold thousand-dollar courses. I've generated $60k from automations - decent, not extraordinary. But that real-world experience taught me what actually works, which is why 100,000+ people learn from me.""

**Conversion Page:**
""Fair warning: This isn't a get-rich-quick program. Most people take 2-3 weeks to build their first working system. But when it runs successfully for the first time, you'll understand why slow and steady beats fast and broken.""

**About Page:**
""I don't take client work anymore - teaching takes all my time. But that means every template, every system, every example comes from real projects that had to work. No theory, just battle-tested solutions.""

---

## Rule 6: Show Don't Tell
**Principle:** Describe the experience, not the feature.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
Instead of: ""Automate your lead generation""
Write: ""Monday morning: Your pipeline report is already in Slack. Data pulled from three systems, formatted, and sent. You haven't even opened your laptop yet.""

**Conversion Page:**
Instead of: ""Save time on reporting""
Write: ""That Friday afternoon panic when leadership wants updated numbers? Gone. Your dashboard refreshes itself every morning at 7 AM. You just screenshot and send.""

**About Page:**
Instead of: ""I scaled operations efficiently""
Write: ""I still remember the Monday we processed 1,000 orders before lunch. The same volume that used to take us all week. That's when I knew systems were everything.""

---

## Rule 7: Tie Benefits to Status
**Principle:** Show how this elevates their position among peers.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""When ops teams ask how you 'suddenly have all this time for strategy,' you'll know the automations are working.""

**Conversion Page:**
""Imagine your next leadership meeting: 'We've reduced manual processing by 80%.' Watch your CFO's face when you show the time savings in actual dollars.""

**For Aspiring Consultants:**
""Quote $5,000 for a two-day build while others scramble for $500 projects. Because you have templates that actually work.""

---

## Rule 8: Use Urgency and Scarcity
**Principle:** Create legitimate reasons to act now.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Legitimate Scarcity:**
""I only onboard 20 new members monthly because each gets a 1-on-1 implementation call. December spots: 7 left.""

**Legitimate Urgency:**
""Template access increases to $497 on January 1st. (We're adding 3 new systems and current members get grandfathered at $197)""

**Course Launch:**
""Live implementation week starts Monday. Miss it, and you're building alone until next quarter.""

---

## Rule 9: Implied Authority
**Principle:** Let credentials and proof speak to expertise.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""Join 100,000+ who've learned automation from someone Udemy rated 4.6/5 stars across 3,000+ students.""

**Conversion Page:**
""Top 3% Upwork performer. 100% job success. 350+ hours. Built systems processing millions in revenue.""

**About Page:**
""Mechanical Engineering degree (built things) → Scaled startup 150x (managed things) → Teaching automation (simplifying things).""

---

## Rule 10: Always Have a P.S. Statement
**Principle:** The P.S. is the second-most read part of any copy.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Email P.S.:**
""P.S. - The free course covers 80% of what you need. The paid program is for people who want to go from 'it works' to 'it scales.'""

**Sales Page P.S.:**
""P.S. - If you're thinking 'this is too complex for me,' remember: I teach mechanical engineers AND complete beginners. Same success rate.""

**About Page P.S.:**
""P.S. - Everything I teach comes from real projects that had to work. No theory, just solutions.""

---

## Rule 11: Clear CTAs (Call-to-Actions)
**Principle:** Tell them exactly what to do next.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad CTA:**
""Not ready to invest? Start with my free course → Learn the fundamentals → See if this is right for you → Then decide""

**Conversion Page CTA:**
""Two paths: Ready to build? Join the full program. Want to test the waters? Grab the free course and see how we teach.""

**Email CTA:**
""Take the free course first. If you build one working automation from it, you'll know the paid program will transform your business.""

**Bottom of Blog Posts:**
""Next step: Take the free AI Automation fundamentals course. No fluff, just the core concepts you need. Then decide if you want to go deeper.""

---

## Rule 12: Third Grade Reading Level
**Principle:** Simple words, short sentences, big results.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Instead of:** ""Leverage artificial intelligence to augment operational efficiency""
**Write:** ""Use AI to do boring work faster""

**Instead of:** ""Comprehensive automation framework implementation""
**Write:** ""Copy our templates. Build working systems. Bill clients.""

**Instead of:** ""Synthesize disparate data sources""
**Write:** ""That report you build every week? Let's automate it.""

---

## Bonus Rule: Use Humor (Sparingly)
**Principle:** Light touches of personality without forcing it.

### Examples for AI Automation:

**Ad Copy:**
""My automations aren't pretty. But they run at 3 AM without complaining.""

**Email Subject:**
""Your spreadsheet called. It wants a vacation.""

**About Page:**
""Yes, I name my automations. No, I'm not sorry.""

---

## Quick Implementation Checklist

**Before Publishing Any Copy, Check:**
1. Is the headline strong enough to stop scrolling?
2. Did I mention unique proof (100k taught, Udemy rating, etc.)?
3. Am I clear about who this is (and isn't) for?
4. Do I have a ""because"" for any ask?

## LinkedIn Post Example #1: Social Proof + Simple Solution

**Topic: Manual Reporting (Enhanced Style)**

---

Over 50 teams have eliminated their Friday reporting stress.

Here's the simple approach that works:

Most teams spend 4-6 hours every week pulling data from multiple tools, formatting spreadsheets, and creating charts for Monday meetings.

People overcomplicate this with expensive dashboards and complex integrations.

Here's what actually works:

✅ Connect your 3 main data sources
✅ Set up one simple dashboard  
✅ Automate the weekly refresh
✅ Done

Real example: Marketing team went from 6 hours → 10 minutes of weekly reporting.

Setup time: One afternoon.
Tools needed: Basic. Reliable. Effective.

But here's the best part - their Friday afternoons are free again.

What manual reporting is eating your Friday afternoons?

---

## LinkedIn Post Example #2: Contrarian Take + Step-by-Step

**Topic: Choosing Automation Tools (Enhanced Style)**

---

🔥 My automation hot take: Simple tools beat complex platforms every time.

People share overcomplicated workflows to look smart.

Here's what we actually use with clients (and it works):

Step 1: Map your current manual process (don't skip this)
Step 2: Find the ONE step that takes the most time  
Step 3: Pick the simplest tool that fixes just that step
Step 4: Get it working before adding anything else

This approach took one sales team from 8 hours of weekly manual work → automated in one afternoon.

No complex CRM overhaul. No months of implementation.

Just one simple automation that gave them their time back immediately.

The goal isn't the perfect system. It's meaningful time back in your day, starting this week.

What's the one manual step you'd hand off to automation first?

---

## LinkedIn Post Example #3: Personal Experience + Memorable Framework

**Topic: Corporate vs Startup Efficiency (Enhanced Style)**

---

My biggest lesson after moving from corporate to startup:

(I learned this after watching teams struggle with ""enterprise solutions"")

Simple solutions that work immediately beat perfect solutions that take months.

Because you never know when you'll have that implementation window again.

Here's the 3-step approach we use with every client:

1️⃣ Fix the manual task causing the most daily pain
2️⃣ Make sure the solution works perfectly for 2 weeks  
3️⃣ Then add the next improvement

The goal is simple:
- Build systems that work today
- Stack small wins over time
- Keep your team sane while you improve

This is how we helped 200+ teams reclaim their time without the enterprise software headaches.

Rooting for your efficiency wins.

What's the first manual task you'd eliminate this week?

## Email Newsletter Example

**Subject: The 15-minute rule that saves hours**

---

Hi [Name],

Quick story that might sound familiar:

Yesterday, I watched a team leader spend 15 minutes every morning checking if their overnight data sync worked properly. ""Just a quick check,"" she said.

15 minutes × 5 days = 75 minutes weekly
75 minutes × 50 weeks = 62 hours annually

One person, one ""quick check"" = more than a full work week per year.

Here's what we did: Built a simple notification that tells her immediately if something went wrong. Cost to set up: 2 hours. Time saved: 62 hours annually.

But here's the real win - she told me she starts every day with confidence instead of anxiety.

This is what I call the ""15-minute rule"": Any task you do daily that takes 15+ minutes is worth automating.

What's your 15-minute task?

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. - Next week I'll share the simple tool we used for this (it's free and took 30 minutes to configure).

---

## Enhanced Email Newsletter Example

**Subject: Over 1,000 teams stopped working weekends (here's how)**

---

Hi [Name],

Quick story that might sound familiar:

Last month, a team leader told me: ""We spend every Sunday preparing for Monday's leadership meeting.""

Sound exhausting? It was.

Here's what we did together:

✅ Mapped their Sunday routine (took 15 minutes)
✅ Automated the data collection (took 2 hours to set up)  
✅ Created a simple Monday-ready dashboard (another hour)

Total setup time: 3 hours
Time saved weekly: 4 hours
Weekend stress eliminated: Priceless

But here's what surprised me most - their Monday presentations got better, not worse.

Clean data. Consistent format. Zero weekend panic.

This is what we call the ""Sunday Test"": If your team works weekends to prep for Monday, we can probably fix that in one afternoon.

What's your team's ""Sunday task"" that shouldn't exist?

Rooting for your weekend freedom,
[Your name]

P.S. - Next week I'll share the exact 3-tool setup we used (spoiler: you probably already have 2 of them).

## Enhanced Twitter Thread

**Topic: Simple vs Complex Automation**

---

🔥 Automation hot take: The simple ones actually work.

People share complex workflows to look smart.

Here's what we actually build with clients:

🧵 1/6

2/ Most ""automation experts"" show you 47-step workflows with 12 different tools.

In reality? Our best client results come from 3-step automations using basic tools.

Simple. Reliable. Bulletproof.

3/ Real example:
❌ Complex: 8-tool workflow that breaks every month
✅ Simple: 3-step automation that runs for 2 years straight

Guess which one actually saves time?

4/ Our rule: If it takes more than 30 minutes to explain, it's too complex.

The goal isn't to impress people with your technical skills.

The goal is to get your time back.

5/ What we build:
- Connect Tool A to Tool B
- Set up simple trigger
- Define clear action
- Done

No fancy logic. No edge cases. Just reliable time savings.

6/ The best automation is the one that works every time without you thinking about it.

What's the simplest manual task you'd eliminate first?

## Video Script Opening

**Topic: Why Automation Projects Fail**

---

""Let's talk about why most automation projects fail - and it's probably not what you think.

We often get called in after teams have spent months trying to implement some complex automation system that never quite works the way they hoped.

Here's what usually happened: They started with the question 'What's the best automation tool?' instead of 'What's the specific problem we're trying to solve?'

I want to show you a different approach - one that gets you results in days, not months. Let's start with a real example from last month...""

""This hits home. We've found that the biggest productivity killer isn't lack of tools - it's having too many tools that don't talk to each other. Simple integrations often solve more than fancy new platforms.""

**On a post about work-life balance:**
""Great point about boundaries. We see this with automation projects too - teams think they need to automate everything at once. Starting with just the task that keeps you working late usually makes the biggest impact on work-life balance.""

**On a post about leadership:**
""Love this perspective. In our experience, the best automation projects happen when leaders ask 'What would give my team more time to do meaningful work?' instead of 'How can we do more with less?'""

**Subject: Simple next step for [specific pain point discussed]**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the great conversation yesterday. It sounds like the manual reporting process is creating exactly the kind of Friday stress we specialize in solving.

Based on what you shared, here's what I'd suggest as a simple first step:

Let's spend 30 minutes mapping out your current Friday reporting routine - exactly as it happens today. This helps us identify which piece would give you the biggest time savings if we automated it first.

No commitment needed for that conversation. We've found that even just visualizing the process often reveals quick wins teams can implement immediately.

Would next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon work for a brief call?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - I'll send over that case study we discussed about the team that got their Friday afternoons back. It's a 3-minute read and might give you some ideas even before we chat.

Mottivme Sales - Marcos Daniels Voice,"Framework de Copywriting de Conversão — Marcos Daniels

Visão Geral
Este framework aplica 12 regras comprovadas de copywriting para posicionamento, oferta e comunicação de serviços de automação e escala comercial com IA, direcionado a dois públicos:
- Empresários e gestores comerciais que querem previsibilidade e tempo livre sem perder controle.
- Agências e consultores que querem escalar operações sem depender de planilhas, improviso ou heróis na equipe.
Tudo com o tom estratégico, direto e sem enrolação que reflete a identidade do Marcos: foco em resultado, não em hype.
Regra 1: O Título Vem Primeiro
Princípio: O título define se alguém lê o resto. 80% da performance vem dele.
Exemplos para Automação e Escala Comercial
Títulos de Anúncio:
- “Transformei um funil travado em uma máquina previsível — e te mostro o blueprint.”
- “Como reduzimos 60% do custo de aquisição só reorganizando o processo de SDR.”
- “O método que substitui improviso por sistema — e escala vendas mesmo sem mais equipe.”
Títulos de Página de Conversão:
- “Construa uma operação de vendas que roda sozinha — e gera resultado com menos pressão.”
- “De caótico para previsível: como montar um BPO comercial com inteligência e processo.”
- “Playbooks prontos e automações validadas — o mesmo sistema usado em operações reais.”
Títulos de Página ‘Sobre’:
- “De executor a estrategista: como montei BPOs que vendem sem precisar de heróis.”
- “Sou obcecado por sistemas comerciais que escalam — porque vivi o caos de não tê-los.”
Regra 2: Diga o Que Só o Marcos Pode Dizer
Princípio: Sua prova única é o que ninguém consegue copiar.
Exemplo de Anúncio:
 “Já desenhei e escalei operações comerciais para dezenas de negócios B2B e B2C. Montei um BPO completo de Social Selling e SDR que entrega com métricas reais — não promessas. Hoje ensino líderes e agências a estruturar times e automações que não quebram quando o volume aumenta.”
Página de Conversão:
 “Depois de operar e escalar times de SDR para mais de 100 clientes, entendi o que realmente faz uma operação de vendas girar. Agora compartilho esse modelo com empresários e agências que querem previsibilidade, eficiência e crescimento sem loucura.”
Página ‘Sobre’:
 “Arquiteto de Processos Comerciais e Especialista em Escala com IA. Já vi o que funciona — e o que não — em dezenas de negócios. Meu foco hoje é transformar estratégias em sistemas replicáveis que unem pessoas, processos e tecnologia.”
Regra 3: Fale com Quem É (E Quem Não É)
Princípio: Polarize. Quem tenta falar com todos, perde todos.
Anúncio:
 “Feito para quem quer construir operações previsíveis, treinar pessoas com método e escalar sem precisar de mais braços.
 Não é para quem ainda acredita que precisa ‘contratar mais vendedores’ para vender mais.”
Página de Conversão:
 Ideal se você:
- Quer parar de apagar incêndio e construir previsibilidade.
- Já tem leads, mas não tem processo para convertê-los em receita recorrente.
- Está pronto para transformar conhecimento em sistema e sistema em lucro.
Evite se você:
- Quer atalhos ou promessas mágicas.
- Acha que IA sozinha resolve sem processo humano.
- Ainda trabalha sem métrica, sem CRM e sem rotina.
Página ‘Sobre’:
 “Trabalho com dois perfis: empresários que querem escalar com inteligência e líderes que querem sair do operacional para estruturar times que vendem sem depender deles.”
Regra 4: Sempre Tenha um “Porque”
Princípio: Pessoas agem mais quando entendem o motivo.
Anúncio:
 “Estou abrindo novas vagas no Programa de Arquitetura Comercial porque 6 donos de agência pediram ajuda para padronizar processos de SDR e escalar sem perder qualidade.”
Página de Conversão:
 “Criei o blueprint de operação previsível porque percebi um padrão: 80% das empresas travam não por falta de leads, mas por falta de estrutura no meio do funil.”
E-mail:
 “Lancei este treinamento porque é o momento certo: 2025 será o ano em que quem não tiver sistema comercial vai perder espaço pra quem tem IA bem aplicada.”
Regra 5: Admita Suas Limitações (E Mostre Força Real)
Princípio: Vulnerabilidade estratégica gera confiança.
Anúncio:
 “Não prometo mágica. Já errei otimizando processos que viraram monstros. Hoje ensino o que realmente funciona — o essencial que mantém a operação fluindo e lucrativa.”
Página de Conversão:
 “Sem enrolação: estruturar uma operação previsível leva 15 a 30 dias. Mas quando roda, não depende mais de sorte — depende de sistema.”
Página ‘Sobre’:
 “Não vendo curso, vendo processo validado. Tudo vem de operação real, testada em campo com métricas, equipe e cliente de verdade.”
Regra 6: Mostre, Não Diga
Exemplo:
 Em vez de “Automatize sua prospecção”, escreva:
 “Segunda-feira, 8h: 32 leads qualificados já no CRM, cada um com score, histórico e próxima ação. E ninguém precisou mandar planilha no grupo do WhatsApp.”
Regra 7: Conecte Benefício a Status
Exemplo:
 “Quando te perguntarem como você conseguiu triplicar resultado sem aumentar equipe, você vai sorrir — e pensar nos seus sistemas comerciais rodando sozinhos.”
Regra 8: Use Urgência e Escassez Reais
Exemplo:
 “Abro apenas 10 novas operações assistidas por trimestre — porque acompanho cada uma de perto. Restam 3 vagas para este ciclo.”
Regra 9: Autoridade Implícita
Exemplo:
 “Responsável por estruturar mais de 100 operações comerciais. Criador de playbooks usados por SDRs e closers que batem meta todos os meses. Especialista em escalar BPOs de Social Selling com IA integrada.”
Regra 10: Tenha um P.S. Estratégico
Exemplo de E-mail:
 “P.S. — Não é sobre automatizar tudo. É sobre automatizar o que consome sua energia e trava o crescimento. Esse é o foco do modelo.”
Regra 11: CTAs Claros
Exemplo:
 “Quer sair do improviso e escalar com sistema?
 → Agende uma consultoria gratuita de diagnóstico
 → Entenda seu gargalo
 → Veja se o modelo se aplica à sua operação.”
Regra 12: Clareza é Rei
Exemplo:
 Em vez de “Implementamos frameworks de eficiência operacional em ecossistemas comerciais complexos”
 → “Simplificamos seu processo de vendas e automatizamos o que te faz perder tempo.”
Regra Bônus: Use Humor com Propósito
Exemplo:
 “Sim, ainda vejo vendedores usando planilha de Excel pra acompanhar follow-up. E sim, ainda me dá vontade de automatizar até o café deles.”
Checklist de Implementação
Antes de publicar qualquer copy, pergunte:
1. O título para o scroll?
2. Há prova única real?
3. Estou falando com o público certo (e afastando o errado)?
4. Dei um motivo claro para agir?
5. Mostrei vulnerabilidade autêntica?
6. Mostrei a experiência (não só o recurso)?
7. Eleva o status do leitor?
8. A urgência é legítima?
9. Há marca de autoridade?
10. Tem P.S. estratégico?
11. CTA claro?
12. Está simples o suficiente para um gestor ocupado entender em 5 segundos?
Guia de Tom de Voz — Marcos Daniels
1. Simplificador Estratégico
Pega complexidade (CRM, IA, BPO, funil, equipe) e traduz em execução clara e acionável.
2. Mentor Executivo
Fala de igual para igual com CEOs e heads de vendas. Usa “nós”, fala de negócio, não de ferramenta.
3. Construtor de Sistemas com Pele em Jogo
Não fala do que leu, fala do que rodou. Cada frase vem de campo, não de teoria.
Padrões de Linguagem
Frases típicas do Marcos:
- “Vamos estruturar isso de um jeito que escale.”
- “Não é sobre mais gente, é sobre mais sistema.”
- “Processo bom é o que funciona quando você não está olhando.”
- “Menos emoção, mais método.”
- “Transforme repetição em receita previsível.”
Evite:
- Buzzwords vazias (sinergia, disrupção, mindset)
- Jargão técnico não traduzido
- Copy de palco tipo “7 dígitos em 7 dias”
- Linguagem de promessa
- Falar em features sem mostrar impacto no caixa
- Quer que eu monte agora o texto de posicionamento principal (como se fosse a “AI Automation Academy” do Marcos) — algo como “Marcos Daniels | The Process Scaling Academy”, com headline, subtítulo, bullets e CTA — pronto pra página de venda e anúncio?","Conteúdo de Exemplo no Tom de Voz de Marcos Daniels
Exemplo de Post no LinkedIn #1 — Prova Real + Solução Prática
Tema: Follow-ups e rotinas comerciais travadas (versão aprimorada)
Mais de 40 empresas eliminaram o estresse do follow-up manual de leads.
Aqui está o que realmente funciona:
A maioria dos times de vendas ainda gasta 3 a 5 horas por semana revisando CRM, checando histórico e mandando mensagens uma a uma.
Eles tentam resolver isso com novas ferramentas — mas o problema não é a ferramenta.
 É a falta de processo.
O que a gente faz é simples:
✅ Organizar o funil com base em etapas de decisão, não de vaidade
 ✅ Padronizar mensagens com gatilhos psicológicos de avanço
 ✅ Automatizar a rotina de follow-up e atualização no CRM
 ✅ Treinar o time para usar a automação com contexto humano
Exemplo real: um BPO de Social Selling foi de 48 horas semanais manuais para 6 horas totais (com mais conversão).
Tempo de setup: 3 dias.
 Ferramentas: CRM, IA e disciplina de processo.
O melhor resultado?
 O time parou de correr atrás de lead — e começou a gerenciar pipeline com inteligência.
Qual parte do seu processo comercial ainda depende de “lembrar de fazer”?
Exemplo de Post no LinkedIn #2 — Visão Contrária + Passo a Passo
Tema: Por que automação sem processo destrói resultado
🔥 Opinião impopular: automatizar o caos só acelera o erro.
Vejo muita empresa tentando “escalar com IA” antes de arrumar o básico.
Aqui está o que realmente funciona em operações comerciais reais:
Passo 1: Mapear o processo atual — do primeiro contato até o fechamento.
 Passo 2: Identificar o gargalo que mais consome energia humana.
 Passo 3: Definir a automação mínima viável (1 gatilho, 1 ação, 1 entrega).
 Passo 4: Validar com o time e medir impacto em tempo e conversão.
Essa estrutura levou uma operação B2B de 7 dias de ciclo de follow-up → para 36 horas com o mesmo time.
Sem trocar CRM.
 Sem contratar mais SDR.
 Sem promessas mágicas.
O foco não é ter o sistema perfeito — é ter sistema que escala sem travar.
Qual é o gargalo mais caro do seu funil hoje?
Exemplo de Post no LinkedIn #3 — Experiência Pessoal + Framework Memorável
Tema: Do “modo herói” ao “modo sistema”
Minha maior virada foi quando parei de tentar “salvar o comercial” e comecei a estruturar o comercial.
Aprendi que processo bem desenhado vale mais do que 10 vendedores motivados e sem método.
Aqui está o framework que uso hoje com todos os clientes:
1️⃣ Padronize o processo (ninguém escala improviso).
 2️⃣ Automatize o previsível (humanize o estratégico).
 3️⃣ Valide com dados, não com opinião.
Esse modelo já transformou operações inteiras de SDR e pré-vendas em 30 dias, sem contratar ninguém novo.
O objetivo é simples:
- Parar de depender de pessoas certas e passar a depender de sistema certo.
- Reduzir custo por lead atendido.
- Aumentar previsibilidade de receita.
Processo bom é aquele que roda mesmo quando o dono viaja.
Seu comercial sobreviveria a uma semana sem você?
Exemplo de Newsletter
Assunto: A regra das 2 horas que muda o jogo
Oi [Nome],
História real de ontem:
Um gestor me disse — “Marcos, perco 2 horas toda segunda-feira só atualizando status no CRM. É rápido, mas constante.”
2 horas × 4 semanas = 8 horas por mês.
 8 horas × 12 meses = quase duas semanas por ano só alimentando sistema.
O que fizemos:
 Construímos uma automação simples que atualiza status conforme as interações no e-mail e WhatsApp.
 Tempo de setup: 3 horas.
 Tempo economizado: 90+ horas anuais.
Mas o melhor resultado não foi o tempo — foi a clareza de funil.
 Agora ele sabe exatamente onde o time trava e o que gera avanço real.
Chamo isso de “Regra das 2 Horas”: qualquer rotina semanal que toma mais de 2 horas deve virar sistema.
Qual é a sua “tarefa das 2 horas” escondida?
Até já,
 Marcos
P.S. — Semana que vem te mostro o dashboard simples que uso para monitorar eficiência de SDR (feito no Airtable + Make).
Exemplo Aprimorado de Newsletter
Assunto: Como um time de vendas parou de trabalhar no sábado
Oi [Nome],
Uma gestora me contou: “Todo sábado o time revisa planilhas e atualiza contatos manuais pra não perder lead.”
Cansativo? Bastante.
O que fizemos juntos:
✅ Mapeamos a rotina (30 minutos)
 ✅ Automatizamos a sincronização CRM ↔ WhatsApp ↔ E-mail
 ✅ Criamos um painel de controle com alertas automáticos
Setup: 4 horas.
 Tempo economizado: 5 horas semanais.
 Estresse de sábado: eliminado.
E o mais curioso: as conversões subiram.
 Por quê? Porque o time descansou e começou a segunda com energia — e pipeline limpo.
Chamamos isso de “Teste do Sábado”: se o time precisa revisar manualmente leads no fim de semana, o processo está errado.
Qual é o “trabalho de sábado” do seu time que o sistema pode resolver?
Pelos seus finais de semana livres,
 Marcos
P.S. — Semana que vem envio o setup exato que usamos (spoiler: 100% no Make + CRM).
Thread no X (Twitter) — Automação de Vendas Sem Frescura
🔥 Verdade incômoda: 90% das empresas não precisam de mais ferramenta — precisam de processo.
🧵 1/7
2/ Todo mundo fala de “IA no comercial”, mas ninguém fala que 80% das dores vêm de tarefas que nem deveriam existir.
3/ Nossos melhores cases vieram de automações com 3 passos e ferramentas básicas.
 Exemplo real:
 ❌ Antes: 6 planilhas, 4 sistemas, 10 pessoas atualizando dados.
 ✅ Depois: 1 CRM integrado + 1 automação de atualização diária.
4/ Resultado? 12 horas semanais economizadas.
 5/ Regra que seguimos: se precisa de tutorial pra entender o fluxo, está complexo demais.
 6/ O objetivo não é parecer tech — é escalar sem dor.
 7/ Comece pelo gargalo mais caro. Resolva ele. Depois o resto.

Roteiro de Discovery Call
Abertura:
 “Valeu por reservar um tempo. Quero entender o que está te levando a buscar estrutura e automação comercial agora.
 Como é hoje a rotina do seu time de vendas no dia a dia?”
Perguntas-Chave:
- “Onde o time mais perde tempo hoje?”
- “Que parte do processo mais te preocupa quando o volume aumenta?”
- “O que você já tentou resolver e ainda não virou resultado?”
Transição:
 “Perfeito. Isso é bem parecido com o que vimos em uma operação recente.
 Eles estavam travando exatamente nesse ponto — e o que fizemos foi simplificar o processo antes de automatizar. O resultado foi previsibilidade total em 15 dias.”
Encerramento:
 “Baseado nisso, aqui vai o que eu faria primeiro no seu caso — e te explico o porquê. Vamos destrinchar juntos em 30 minutos e ver se o modelo se encaixa.”
Vídeo — “Por Que a Maioria das Operações Comerciais Falha”
“Vamos direto ao ponto: a maioria das operações falha porque começa pelo software, não pelo processo.
Todo dia vejo times trocando CRM, contratando mais SDRs, adicionando IA — mas sem corrigir a estrutura.
O problema nunca é ferramenta. É sequência, é clareza, é execução previsível.
Hoje eu quero te mostrar o modelo que faz o comercial rodar mesmo quando o volume dobra — e sem precisar contratar ninguém novo.”
Exemplos de Comentários no LinkedIn
Em post sobre produtividade comercial:
 “Total. O que mata a produtividade não é a falta de ferramenta — é a ausência de rotina e cadência padronizada. O CRM só amplifica o que já existe (ou o caos).”
Em post sobre liderança:
 “Liderar time de vendas hoje é mais sobre desenhar processos do que motivar. Quando o sistema certo está rodando, a motivação vem do resultado.”
Em post sobre IA no comercial:
 “IA não substitui vendedor — substitui tarefa repetitiva. O segredo é: quanto mais humano o comercial, mais técnico precisa ser o processo.”

Assunto: Próximo passo simples para resolver [gargalo discutido]
Oi [Nome],
Valeu pela conversa ontem.
 Pelo que você descreveu, o gargalo no seu processo de qualificação é exatamente o tipo de travamento que a gente resolve toda semana.
Minha sugestão:
 Vamos marcar 30 minutos pra mapear esse fluxo — exatamente como ele acontece hoje.
 Esse diagnóstico rápido já mostra onde estão os gargalos e o que pode ser automatizado primeiro pra gerar ganho imediato.
Sem compromisso, só clareza.
Terça ou quarta funcionam pra você?
