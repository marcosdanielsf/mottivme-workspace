I built two companies doing over $30
million in sales by copying already
successful businesses.
&gt;&gt; Meet Will. After the real estate crash
in 2008, he lost everything and had to
start from scratch.
&gt;&gt; We didn't see it coming and we just
totally got crushed.
&gt;&gt; Then he came across the opportunity to
build a SAS, but he didn't do it in the
conventional way. Instead of reinventing
the wheel and building something that
didn't exist yet, he developed a
framework that led him to make millions
of dollars. This is kind of the cold
email framework that we use for Uplead
and I think anyone can kind of use this
and apply this to their business today.
&gt;&gt; In this video, Will shares his
million-dollar research framework, how
to successfully copy lucrative
businesses, and the one marketing
strategy that's made him millions of
dollars.
&gt;&gt; The playbooks are already out there.
Most people just don't study them.
&gt;&gt; Whether you're a seasoned builder or
just getting started, this episode might
blow your mind. All right, let's get
into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is
Starter Story.
All right, welcome Will to the channel.
Tell me about who you are, what you
built, and what's your story.
&gt;&gt; My name is Will Cannon. I built UpLED to
over $30 million in sales, and I built
Signature Lead to over 1.6 million users
without raising a dime of funding. I did
it all without reinventing the wheel. I
took business models that already had
product market fit and I added my own
little twist to them.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. We're going to get all into
this framework of how you built these
and took these proven markets. But
first, I want to understand a little bit
more about your background. How do you
get here to this place where you have
these awesome software businesses?
&gt;&gt; So, at 19, me and my girlfriend, who's
now my wife, started our first mortgage
company. This was during the subprime
mortgage boom. So, there was mortgages
being handed out left and right. And we
were kind of new to the industry. We're
like, what's going on? We started making
so much money we couldn't even believe
it. And we thought we were on top of the
world. This was 2005, 2006, 2007.
Everything was going great. And then the
mortgage crisis hit. We didn't see it
coming and we just totally got crushed.
So, then it was time to rebuild. We were
like, "Hey, what are we going to do
next?" When we had our mortgage company,
we were sending a lot of cold emails to
loan officers and real estate agents to
recruit them. And we had a couple people
in our office that would ask us like,
"Hey, do you have a list of loan
officers or list of real estate agents?"
So, we were kind of selling lists on the
side and we thought, "Hey, this could be
a business." So, we started diving into
that further. That's what we did for
about 10 years from 2007ish to 2017. We
kept running into the same problem, data
quality. And that was the kind of the
aha moment. We're like, "Hey, there has
to be a way or a software that can do
this for us." So that was the thought
behind Uplead and that was our
transition from 10 years of building an
agency into SAS.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, before we get into
these businesses that you built, how
you've grown them and the framework for
finding these ideas for these proven
markets, can you break down how you
actually found the ideas for your two
big software companies that you run now?
&gt;&gt; For Uple agency, so the data quality
from the vendors on the market at the
time was around 50 to 60% accurate. We'd
scrape the internet for data and that
data was also maybe 40 50% accurate.
every time we build a list, we'd have to
verify the emails. We'd have to send the
phone number list to a call center we
had in the Philippines to verify the
phone numbers. And that was the kind of
the aha moment. We're like, hey, why
isn't there a tool that can just do this
for us? Why isn't there a tool where I
can go in, I can punch in my ICP, I can
say, here's who I want to target. I
click download or export and it'll
download and verify the emails and
verify the phone numbers in real time.
We didn't find any software. We decided
to build it ourselves for Signature
League, which now has over 1.6 million
users. This is how we found the idea.
This was 2020 and we saw everything was
moving away from face to face. So we
knew documents weren't being signed face
to face anymore. They were being signed
over the internet. So we looked this
model up and we saw Docu Sign was the
biggest player in the game. They were
public. They had a ton of revenue. But
their product was complicated. It wasn't
easy to use. So we thought there has to
be a better way. Why don't we build a
simple, easy to use version of DocYsine
that was so easy to use your grandmother
could use it. That's how we knew this
business could be successful. There was
already proven product market fit. There
was a need in the market for customers
that wanted a simple version of a tool
that was already on the market and we
used our SEO and cold email and other
skill sets to acquire customers
profitably.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you did this for two very
successful businesses. You have this
framework for finding ideas that are
already proven and then just going and
building them doing them somewhat
differently. Can you walk me through
this framework so that someone watching
could potentially do the same? Step one
is I would look for markets that already
have product market fit. I mean, I'm not
Steve Jobs. I had 1.5 GPA growing up.
So, I thought it was a lot easier to go
into a market that already has product
market fit. Now that you found a market
that you want to compete in, the next
step is finding your unique angle,
putting a unique twist on it. It can't
just be pricing. It can't just be, hey,
we're like XYZ, but a little bit more
affordable. There has to be some unique
twist to it. So, go look at the one and
two star reviews and see what people are
complaining about. See what they dislike
about the best players in the market.
That's our twist. Our twist is what
people dislike about the biggest
companies in the space because those are
the easiest customers to go after and
acquire. And that's step three,
acquiring customers profitably. Now,
this is the hardest part, but if you can
get this right, you can build any
business. This is the hardest part
because you have to have a skill set
here. Whether it's cold email, whether
it's cold calling, whether it's SEO,
whether it's ads. So, my skill sets are
around cold email, cold calling, SEO,
and a few others. I acquired all of
these by reading books, by watching
YouTube videos. And step four is
execution. Most people talk about
building a business, but actually
building it is a lot harder. You're
going to fail. You're going to have to
get back up. You're going to have to
keep going. And this playbook, it might
not work the first time. I failed at
probably over 20 different businesses
before having two successful businesses.
I think that framework is awesome. I
love that playbook. Clearly, it's worked
for you for two very successful
businesses. But for anyone who's
watching right now, I think they might
be wondering, how can I do this right
now? What are the opportunities that can
work in 2025? I'm sure you've come
across a bunch of painful problems that
you love to solve, but you don't have
time for. What would you be building
right now that the audience can learn
from?
&gt;&gt; One idea is a super simple CRM. Almost
every business needs a CRM. It's a big
market. It's fragmented. There's
multiple companies doing billions of
dollars in revenue. This is an area I
would probably look at if I was building
something new today. Number two, I would
say a payroll software for small
businesses. You have a bunch of
companies in the space. Again, really
fragmented, multiple winners in the
space. If you look at Fresh Books and
their SEO strategy around templates and
tools, I'd probably copy that playbook
right there, right? They've built the
playbook for you. There's an SEO
advantage I would have in that market.
Number three, I would say a website
analytics tool. Every business needs to
analyze their metrics, their funnel, how
much traffic they're getting to their
website, attribution, ROI. Your market
is almost infinite. And if you can tie
in some new things right now around AI,
around maybe mentions on LLMs within the
analytics tool, I think that'd be a cool
tool to start today.
&gt;&gt; All right, before we keep going here, I
do got to call out something I've been
seeing with a lot of founders right now.
You're moving fast. Maybe you're close
to product market fit or you're prepping
for your next round, but then enterprise
prospects start asking about your
security compliance and suddenly
everything slows down. The reality is
that in 2025, especially with AI,
security expectations hit earlier and
harder than ever. You can either get
ahead of it or let it become the thing
that kills your momentum. Vanta, today's
sponsor, basically solves that entire
headache. Instead of spending months
figuring out SOCK 2 compliance, Vanta's
automated workflows get you audit ready
fast. And here's what I really like
about the platform. It's not just a
one-time setup. It keeps monitoring and
updating as you scale. Fast growing
startups like Langchain, Writer, and
Cursor trusted Vanta to build their
security foundation early, which means
they can focus on growth instead of
getting stuck in compliance hell. Right
now, Vanta is offering $1,000 off for
Starter Story viewers. So, check out

already using Vanta to scale smarter.
Huge thank you to Vanta for partnering
with us at Startertory. Let's dive back
into the interview. I want to hear a
little bit more about your businesses
that you built. We haven't really talked
about them yet, but can you share the
two businesses that you built in
software that are crushing it right now?
What do they do? How do they work? And
how are they doing? Uple is a B2B data
provider with real-time verified emails,
mobile numbers, and buyer intent
signals. Uple has over $4,000 customers
currently. It's done over $30 million in
sales, and it gets over 100,000 visits
to its website every month. And the
other business I have is Signaturely.
It's an e signature company. It's an
easy and simple to use alternative to
docuine. So, Signaturely has over 1.6
million users. It's done over 1.5
million in sales and it gets over
800,000 visits per month.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. And those are amazing
businesses beyond the framework for
finding these ideas, which we talked a
bunch about. I'd also be curious to hear
about how you actually grew and scaled
these businesses. Can you tell me a
little bit more about that?
&gt;&gt; Uple got its first 1 million in annual
recurring revenue strictly from cold
email. So, this is kind of the cold
So, here's the cold email that got us
our first million dollars in ARR. I'll
break it down. The subject line is, "Hi,
first name." So, hi James. The first
line is, "I was checking out your
LinkedIn profile and thought this could
be of value to you. We built a tool
called Uple, which is like Zoom Info but
with real-time email verification, and
we're really affordable. Are you open to
trying it out at no cost?" So, the
subject line is, "Hi, James. It looks
like it came from a real person." The
intro is neutral and direct. I saw your
profile. There's no hype there. The
value prop is clear and familiar. We
framed it against the biggest company in
the market, Zoom Info, but better. We
told what our twist is. And then the
ask, are you open to trying it out at no
cost? We try to make the ask so easy
it's hard to say no. You don't need long
emails. You need short ones that feel
human. And I think any business can take
this. They can tweak those lines and
they can send out the same cold email
that we did. So from Signature, we got
from 0 to 1.6 million users mainly from
SEO. We use the strategy around tools
and templates and ranking for them high
in search in order to get our first
customers. We built a free online
signature tool where you can type or
handdraw your signature and you can
download it and then we push them to go
use that to sign documents. So that was
a one of the tools we use as part of our
funnel. And then we also wrote
templates. So we wrote marketing
agreements and construction agreements
and landlord agreements and we ranked a
bunch of templates. Templates and
contracts and that was how we got our
first thousand plus customers.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thanks for sharing that. I
mean, SEO, I love SEO. Big reason
Starter Story grew as well. The last
question that I have for you that we ask
everyone who comes on Starter Story, you
built these amazing businesses. What
would you say to a younger Will, if you
could stand on his shoulder and give him
advice from when you were just starting
out, you had the failed mortgage
company. What would be your advice to
someone just starting out like you?
&gt;&gt; Have these big, hairy, audacious goals,
these crazy goals, these moonshots,
right? I remember when I was first
starting out, I thought if I could just
make $5,000 a month, that would be
enough. and then you hit that and then
you go to the next level. So have big
goals. Another one is things are going
to come up every day that get in your
way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Think
about the big picture. Another piece of
advice is you have to just keep going.
You're going to fail. You're going to
have to get back up, right? I failed at
probably 15, 20 different businesses
before I built two that were super
successful. Well, thanks for coming on
the channel. I appreciate you sharing
your story and these amazing businesses
that you built. Hope to have you on
again sometime and see your businesses
grow even more. So, thanks for coming
on.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Pat. Thanks again
to Will for coming on to the channel and
sharing his story. I love his approach
to building businesses where it's not
about creating a whole new category, but
instead just adding a small twist on
what's already out there. If you're
looking to do something similar, then
definitely check out Starter Story
Build. It's our program where we teach
you how to use in demand AI coding tools
