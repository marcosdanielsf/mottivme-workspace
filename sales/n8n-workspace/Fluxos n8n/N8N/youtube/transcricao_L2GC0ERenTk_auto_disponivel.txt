so I've made like $30 million online and a pretty large chunk of that has come as as a result of and because of my personal brand um I think I've probably made like8 maybe $10 million in deals alone that have come from calls from my main YouTube channel from this business Channel now so let's talk about it there are 1 two 3 four five six reasons as to why your Channel or your personal brand is not growing or is not making you money first piece of advice is your content sucks it literally is that simple and a lot of you watching this you're not going to want to hear this a lot of you are thinking right now your ego is a bit triggered you're a little bit like I'm not saying this to get one up on you I'm not saying this to you know be to to hurt you the truth is that if your videos were deserving of more views they would get more views the algorithms are incredibly Fair these social media companies YouTube Instagram all these all these companies are engineered to they they are perfectly incentivized to show content that is good and so if you're not getting views and if your content isn't isn't expanding and getting views it's because it sucks now whether something sucks or not is only in contrast to and proportion to something else and so what it means is that the reason your content isn't blowing up or isn't getting views is because it sucks more than content that is and it's that is literally just that simple there's there's nothing else to it than that that is the 8020 rule that's the big biggest piece of advice is your content probably sucks it's like oh like you know I I have lots of clients who have YouTube channels and we've got some of the Mastermind some in Easy gr and they'll come to me they'll be like Charlie like why are my videos not getting views and I'll be like oh let's just watch one and then like a minute in I'm like dude this is a [ __ ] video this just sucks and you know is literally just that most there there there there's five other the points that I'm going to share with you that are going to help you and you know help you realize as to why you're not growing but videos just suck man like let's be honest for a second here like let's say you've been doing YouTube for like a year or six months and you've been consistent and you've been putting in the effort but you're not getting views it's because you're not good enough and I'm I'm not here to tell you that with some level of weird ego or Pride your videos just suck and the question then becomes like well okay well how do I make my video not suck well you just need to be better and try harder and put more effort in and be smarter and you know look at your competitors like this is why I'm not bigger than hosi it's because josi's videos are way better than mine This Is Why I'm not bigger than imman because imman's videos are way better than mine like you get exactly what you deserve when it comes to YouTube views or social media presence like to a te what you get you deserve so you know if someone's out there getting 10 times more views than you is because their videos are 10 times better than yours or because you know that their content is is better or more advanced or just deeper or they're better right so no one wants to hear this and no one wants to talk about this but it really is the easiest thing just make better videos and then you might be sat there with yourself like you're thinking well I don't know how to make better videos it's like well figure it out man the only reason my videos get the views they do is because they deserve to get those views and the only reason that my videos don't get more views than what they get is because they don't deserve more views like you get what you deserve perfectly now the second thing and this kind of comes into the video sucking thing is like you're not unique so this is the issue and this is why your videos suck is because like this is this is point number two is is you're not unique because you're copying everyone and all of your ideas and all of your content and all of your brain and all the information that you're trying to share with people is coming from the other people you're watching on YouTube and this is a huge problem like I see this all the time where like people copy my videos and they'll copy it ver and they'll get like 1% of the views that I might get sometimes even less and it's because everyone watching that video has already seen the video that you've copied it from and so people they don't respond very well to information that is not novel which means new or unique right and so you know we saw this a lot with Hamza for example big self-improvement YouTuber hundreds thousands of people started copying his videos got nowhere near the the results or effort because YouTube is always going to recommend those new videos that contain the same information to people who have already watched hamza's videos because if you think if you're making videos for the same audience as someone else but you're copying their videos then what means what that means is that that person has already reached that person with that information which means if they click on yours and it's the same thing they're just going to go back to the source and you know this is a huge thing is your videos just are not unique like in in order for your channel to grow and in order for your personal brand to explode you need to create a unique viewer experience which means that when someone watches your videos they they can't really bucket or categorize you into someone else or something else and you know like I've I've done this before with like you know the Sam oven style whiteboard videos on my main Channel and like for a while people started saying like y he's copying Sam ens like Charlie's just a Sam ens copycat but because Sam hadn't been making videos for like six years it didn't really matter and then what started happening is everyone copied the Whiteboard thing from me because I copied Sam and then people started commenting on these people's videos saying oh you're copying Charlie Morgan's whiteboard Style videos and and then this whiteboard thing just took off you know not that I started the trend cuz I didn't literally I just copied sound right but the reason that I managed to blow up with the Whiteboard thing before everybody else and the reason it became my thing is because I copied someone who hadn't done it for like seven years and the same thing is true with the style of content that I'm doing now on my main channel is making these sort of 10 minute short shorter form um videos with the iPad talking about like neurochemistry and like discipline and stuff and like what I what I try and do with my content is I'm I'm always trying to refresh the experience every six months or so every year and I'm trying to talk about stuff that's unique stuff that people either haven't talked about in like half a decade or stuff that people have never talked about before and this is how you capture attention and this is how you get views is when you come up with new ideas and new ways to solve problems that are like fresh cuz people are like damn like you know when I made um when I made the video um how to UNF your life like a millionaire it's got like 300K views or something now like and I started talking about like like trauma transmutation and like all the people were like what the hell I've never seen this before I've never heard this before and it's you know all my best videos are just like ideas that not necessarily titles but ideas the content of the video is something that hasn't been seen before and you know this is the same thing with like let's say that you're think about like reading a book or watching a movie it's like you're going to basically want to watch content that like if you you don't want to watch the same movie twice unless it's a really good movie but usually like if you're watching a movie and it's like identical to another one you've already watched you'll just stop watching it same thing with a series same thing with a book so content has got to be unique now the third thing is you're not growing so my strategy for YouTube is incredibly straightforward I grow personally and in business and I make an effort to push my financial and personal trajectory forward and I document my lessons and what I've learned from exploring the chaos so that's kind of how I see this thing is I'm looking to grow myself and my business and it's a very chaotic stressful thing to do but then along the way I pick up little lessons and things that I've learned in this Uncharted unexplored Territory that no one's really been to before and then I I translate that into articulated content form and send that to my my audience and that's how I never run out of ideas and that's how my content always feels fresh and new anytime I've had a YouTube stagnation or anytime I've had a personal brand stagnation it's because my income hasn't increased but when I'm trying to solve new problems when I'm trying to make new Leaps and Bounds of progress in the business I'm actively trying to grow the thing it opens up this portal in your brain and ideas just flow to you and your YouTube just becomes this journal almost your personal brand becomes this journal for you know creating content around new things that you've learned and because it's new to you it's usually new to everybody else and when you start getting to like the higher echelons of Entrepreneurship in the online space when you start getting to the eight multi8 n figure Mark it's there's not many people there and there's not many people teaching that stuff and specifically in your direction so you can get this massive advantage of of you know you get this you access this huge field of information that's been completely untapped that you can then just start feeding to your audience and people will love you for it this is what happened to Hamza you Hamza went through this transformation of being like a you know lonely loser with no girls to being this you know jacked masculine Adonis man and hamza's golden age of content and any any golden age of content is produced during the biggest transformation and it's so interesting to watch like when someone's going through this big growth period their YouTube and their personal brand just explodes because they're learning so much and and they're just Comm all they're doing is communicating what they've learned to Their audience and this might you might be thinking yeah but I'm not like teaching making money online and stuff but doesn't matter because if you're let's say that you work in the gym Niche and let's say that you're growing the business you're getting more clients which means you're helping more gyms and you're starting masterminds and now you're talking to more people and you're and like if you get if you grow into your industry you should be able to pull those industry insights out and inject them into your YouTube channel right the next thing is huge so it's called personal brand and what this means is you have to be personal and I don't I don't mean that in some like weird we intangible wo way I mean it in the way that a lot of people have personal Brands but they are not themselves they are but anything but themselves like the second you put a camera in front of I'm I'm talking to you right now that the way that I'm talking to you with my feet on my desk with my joggers on leaning back in my chair staring over some words here and there with my hoodie on I'm talking to you in the exact same way that I would talk to my friends my business partner my family I'm not wearing a mask I'm not trying to project an image I'm not trying to be someone I'm not I am being totally completely authentic now am I being completely myself of course not are there some terrible rude jokes that I would make if you weren't here yeah probably right but for the most part I am 90% transparent you know no most of the time I'm completely myself on these videos and obviously there's a piece of Me That You Don't See you know a piece of me that only my very close friends or family would see I'm not going to turn up one of these videos 10 shots of tequila deep and start shouting at you like I might do with my business partner right and trust me I've done that before but most people's brands are not personal and it's so transparent it's so obvious like you know when you watch someone's video and and you're just like it's just feels weird it's like this person isn't being real and the problem with people be the problem with personal Brands is when you're not yourself it's it's near impossible to sustain any level of consistency because every time you pick up the camera you've got to put a mask on and I know this is true because I had this weird stint on my main Channel recently it was it was a few months ago you can go and see the videos and um I was I tried this weird personal brand thing with like the F the fancy clothes and the professional cameras and like the the like standing whiteboards and the scripts and and I did this whole thing but it wasn't me like I was making these videos as someone I didn't even recognize myself it was I hated hated hated hated making those videos and when you're not yourself people are just like what the hell's going on here like one thing you might have noticed I have this weird tendency to like make this noise with my throat I don't know if you've noticed it ever in my videos but sometimes I do it like you can hear like it's like a cough and I do it when I get like um if I haven't slept well like get this weird congestion from what I've eaten or something I don't know I just don't know what happens but I do it and I'm not I'm not trying to like hide anything it's just like I'm just being completely myself and yeah there's going to be some stuff that annoys people there's going to be some stuff people don't like but at the end of the day it's personal and people can like if you want to form a connection with your audience you need to be real in yourself because you know trying to build a personal brand when you're not being yourself if it blows up that's the worst that can happen because now you've got to sustain this this lie and that's really hard and it's kind of like imagine fall imagine falling in love with someone but the only way for you to get them to fall in love with you is to be someone else it's like if they fall in love with they haven't fallen in love with you they fall in love with an image of you and now you have to sustain that image for the rest of your life and it's very exhausting and you're going to resent them and it's going to suck so be yourself people can tell when you're telling the truth people can tell when you're being yourself if you're not it's like I see this all the time with guys in the space and like I know a lot of these YouTubers and these business YouTubers and stuff and you maybe you're some of them and you watch I watch their videos and I'm like this guy it looks like someone's pointing a gun at him all of the jokes are like forced all of the the the it's the perfect posture it's the it's the hand placements it's the it's the it's the cues it's not real it's like it's like I'm watching some sort of robot talk and no one wants to watch a robot talk so don't do it the next thing is inconsistency and this is obvious let's say you have 100,000 subscribers what you have you don't have 100,000 subscribers you have an individual relationship with 100,000 people and you need to show up for each person every single week think of it like this let's say that you're in a relationship with a girl or a boy or a man or a woman or a dog I don't care actually that would be really weird but you're in a relationship with with a person and it is in order for that relationship to work in order for them to like you and in order for them to pay you attention and give you what you want you need to show up for them every week so if I if I have a girlfriend um which I don't which is completely heartbreaking but if I had a girlfriend I would be consistent in going on a date with her every week like every week I'd be like I'll take you out let's go out somewhere let's go to dinner let's go here let's go here let's go here and you would show up consistently for them but people don't do this with their audience and an audience is a relationship it's not a number it's not a it's not just this weird object of status next to your name that is it's if you I have 20,000 subscribers on YouTube right now on my main Channel That's 200,000 individual Souls that's 200,000 people people with problems and lives and situations and I have a relationship in some way shape or form with every single one of them and it is my job and it's my my duty to show up for them every single week in the same way that you would show up for your brother your mother your father your daughter your sister your girlfriend your husband your wife any relationship that you have successfully sustained you have sustained because you showed up for them every week and so I in my four years of doing YouTube have never not once ever missed an upload because I love my audience and I upload for my audience in this in in with the same level of love and in intention that I would upload for my my my wife like it's it's it's it's a connection it's a relationship and you have to show up for them every week and if you miss a week you lose their trust and I know it's not quite like this because not everyone I don't get 200,000 views of videos so not all my subscribers watch my stuff but your core audience you know that that that like 20% 30% of your subscriber base that just shows up for you every single time like they'll they'll be loyal to you if you're loyal to them and so one of the reasons that your personal brand isn't growing is like it's hilarious man like I see people in the space and they did YouTube for like a year and then they gave up then they came back and they gave up and they came back it's like it's like that's just like trying to expect a girl or a man to want a relationship with you after you sort of pick them up and put them down it's it just doesn't work like a these these at the end of the day a personal brand is a relationship with like lots of individual people just aggregated into this weird word called subscriber right so you got to show up for them and then the last thing is your content is not aligned so number six is like alignment of content so I see this where like like people will people will have like a specific type of content they make on their personal brand on their YouTube or their Instagram or their Twitter but every now and then like it gets weird and something gets slipped in that shouldn't be in there and and this is this is rampant at the moment with lifestyle content so you know what we see at the moment is we see like people making videos about how to grow a business how to be successful and then out of nowhere comes a week in the life of a weirdo in Dubai video and and this this works if you have a separate Channel okay I'm not saying you shouldn't do these videos it works if you have a separate channel so like imman for example has his Vlog Channel and he has his main Channel right now I for example have my main Channel I have my business Channel because content like this is not aligned to the Avatar that I want to reach on my main channel so if you want to reach multiple avatars you need multiple channels but I don't get it when someone will be like you know oh like some let's say let's say that it's like a a crypto guy teaching people how to become crypto investors and they make good crypto content and that of nowhere comes like buying a Richard Mill in cash it's like it's like did you really just let your e your ego seep into your interaction with your audience because that's all it is let's be honest people think it's this top of funnel traffic play but what it is it's just your ego running absolutely rampant like most of the time not always some guys are very intelligent with it like like you know I know that Iman for example um is very intentional with his Vlog content and it doesn't serve the purpose of of him projecting his insecurities and ego into the world it's actually like a viable top of funnel attention grabbing strategy but all the other guys that like you know out of nowhere just start making like random lifestyle content or or just other content that's not in any way shape or form aligned to Their audience like it's just it once again it would be like imagine you take your girlfriend on a date every week and she's used to like a a certain sort of mode of conversation she's used to you being a certain way and then one day you turn up and suddenly like you you tell her that you're a Nazi not that lifestyle content is in any way constitute to to the level of Nazism right Nazism but it's it's like you have to be consistent in yourself and it's going to your your content is going to shift and grow and change but there always needs to be some base level of alignment that you can sort of oscillate around and you know you just kind of need to keep your perspectives at Bay so that's really it the reason your personal brand is not growing is because one your videos and your content sucks at least in proportion to the other content of videos on the platform two your videos are not unique and fresh and new and the information that you're sharing is just regurgitated information that people would rather get from The Source three you're not growing so you know you yourself are not you know progressing in life which means that you don't have new things to share and you become this weird Flatline thing and this has happened to lot of people where the second they stop growing their personal brand just dies because PE growth is incredibly seductive to an audience it's it's people want to watch growth like if we take imman again for example or hosi or these guys that have had these you know huge explosions of personal brand and success you you've been able to observe their Journey almost and you get to watch them grow and you get to watch them this this this thing they building expands and you get to sit there and watch it and and they make content about it it's very very Charming um the fourth thing is your person is not personal so it doesn't resemble you or your character or you're just you're just playing this weird character this this mask that isn't you people can tell five inconsistencies you're not showing up for your audience religiously um I show up for my audience like they're God in the same way that like an extreme Christian would never miss church like I never miss an upload and I will never miss an upload for as long as YouTube retains part of my business strategy and then last thing is um number six is your content is not aligned where you're making videos where like it's just it feels weird and inconsistent so yeah if you fix those things your personal brand will grow by the way if you need help getting more clients you can click the links in
