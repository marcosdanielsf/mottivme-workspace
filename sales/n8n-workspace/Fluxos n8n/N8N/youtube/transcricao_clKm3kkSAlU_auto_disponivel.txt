==================================================

I've hired more than 30 sales reps in my time as an entrepreneur and I've made more than $25 million with high tiet sales teams what I'm going to do in this video is walk you through my step-by-step process for finding hiring managing paying incentivizing ramping onboarding and I'm going to give you the whole picture on how to how to hire sales reps now this could be for a service-based business like a agency or a recruiting business this could be for for a coaching or Consulting business or an info business the first and most important thing to hiring sales reps is understanding incentives and really incentives come down to price because the way that you want to pay sales reps for these sorts of roles is percentage commission and if you're not in a position where you're charging a high ticket price I.E thousands of dollars a month or you know tens of thousands of dollars for a specific uh course or product then you're not going to get good reps okay so what I'm going to tell you is how to hire them we're going to go through of A to Z everything from the job post where to post the job post the interview process but none of this really matters if your business doesn't support them because you know when it comes to the performance of a sales rep it really comes down to one of two things it's either the rep and one is the rep and number two is the environment and the environment is basically your company and so you know you could have the the best hands down sales talent in the world but if your company is a crappy environment meaning you're not charging enough clients aren't getting good results you know and and the product sucks and like the operations is a mess like a rep can only perform as well as the environment they're put in and I would rather have a insanely good company environment uh and just average reps than incredible insane reps and a average company environment the environment matters way more than the rep and so if you're not if if your reps aren't closing and getting deals usually it's not always because they're not good sometimes it's because the company environment doesn't suit them and isn't optimal for performance and if you don't believe me just look at your own life and how much your environment affects your position right if you were you if you're living at home and you live in a messy untidy chaotic loud slow Wifi you know Soviet Union esque building like you know you're probably not going to be very productive but if you put yourself in a nice tidy clean straightforward efficient environment you're going to actually get the job done so environment's huge just remember that because you can hire as many reps as you want but if your company sucks then it's all bad so the first place that we have to start is obviously uh surface area so surface area is a term in mathematics used to denote the you know amount of um the length of a surface okay and you might be wondering well what the hell how does that have anything to do with it well when we can in when we increase our surface area what that basically means is we are increasing the amount of the likelihood that someone comes into contact with us okay and so the the key to hiring and the real key to you know successful rep hiring is talking to as many people as humanly possible and I'm talking you want hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of applicants and the only way that get more applicants is by increasing your surface area and the way you increase your surface area is by talking to more people and reaching out to more people and so there's a few things that we can do to find sales reps okay and I'm going to give you some examples so the first thing is posts on social media okay second thing is recruiters SL um hirers we'll call them definitely let's just let's just call them recruiters um you've got lists and you've got socials you've got friends and um yeah that's kind of it so the one that I would recommend that you avoid at the beginning is I would recommend you avoid recruiters because you know there's going to be people out there that say like oh all place a sales rep for you and you know it's going to cost you like somewhere between 5 to 15 grand to place the rep um like I am yet to have a good experience with recruiters um I haven't used them all okay most of them I haven't used but in my experience um and the experience that I've seen from a lot of other people the sales recruiting game is pretty sucky okay now second to this um the one that you're most likely going to use is your posts on social media so what you want to do is you want to go to places like Facebook you go to school groups you go to Reddit communities you Discord communities you need to find the little pockets of the internet where online remote High ticket sales reps congregate and they do congregate there's Facebook groups there's going to be WhatsApp groups you know you're going to have all sorts of stuff and you know what you can also what you can also do is if you know a high ticket closer or you know someone that's already you know in a job closing um then what you can do is you can ask them do you know anyone you know and then this is sort of where the friends thing comes in so whenever I'm looking to make a important hire what I will do is I will go on my WhatsApp and I've got maybe 600 contacts on my WhatsApp that are relevant to of my industry and my business and what I will do is I will just message every single one and say Do you happen to know a high ticket sales rep um you know that would do that and the key if you want to ask friends is to double down on the network and so what this means is you ask your friends you say hello do you know anyone who might be a good high tiet sales rep or if you don't is there anyone in your network who might know someone and then what this does is it it increases your surface area by literally like 50% just by asking the extra question which is a pretty cool thing to do the other option you have is um using email lists I'm going to put down here clients as well but the other option we have is using email lists or using our socials so if you have got an audience or you've got a sizable email list um honestly that can get the job done pretty well and then the other thing is clients so if you have any clients that you think could be potential sales reps then that works really well now there there kind there's kind of a question here as to what sort of rep do you want because really there's going to be two types of potential rep hire um the first one is experienced and the second one is obviously new now in my experience the only time it makes sense to hire really experience sales reps that have got lots of training and have done lots of deals is when you're when you have a very successful company because the experience Guys these guys are expecting 15 20 25k a month right they are really like you know it's kind of chicken an EG scenario because the only way that you get to eight figures multi8 figures High seven figures is by having experience sales reps but they will not work for you unless you're already there and so you know you can try and find experienced sales reps and train sales reps but the ones that are good they're already in jobs and they will not settle for anything less than multi6 figures in commission now they won't expect salary but they will expect commission and one of the first things an experienced sales rep will ask ask you when in in the hiring process is they will say how many people at your company are making 20K a month like what's the highest you know what's the what's the highest performer getting paid in your company and if that is anything short of what their expectation or what they could make is then they won't join you so this kind of leaves us with the you know if you're if you're making your first few rep hires it kind of leaves you in the crappy camp where you're you're going to be hiring people who don't have much sales experience they're still kind of new to the game you know that they're still maybe looking for their first closing role or you know maybe you have to train them up from scratch and give them the script and stuff this is how I did it so you know I I wasn't when I was starting out you know at the beginning I wasn't really in a position to hire experienced talent because you know my product wasn't expensive enough we didn't have enough client results yet I didn't have any I was I was doing the sales myself so there was no sort of any any killer Clos any real proper a player Clos up wouldn't come near us because we had no proof of you know performance there was no sales Management Systems there was no incentives like it was a mess it was a mess so in the beginning you kind of have to be a little bit messy and so what I did is I I hired people who I just thought would be good sales reps that I could train and so you know it's funny um I've got maybe four or five people on my team now we've got 10 sales reps and half of them they joined us you know two three years ago and they' never sold a thing in their life and so we trained them up from scratch where you know we gave them the script now there's another thing that I want to tell you about this before we move on to like what what to post and what to send and you know stuff if you yourself cannot close at a percentage rate that is north of 25 30% do not hire a sales rep please do not I know that doing sales CS sucks and I know it hurts and I know it takes a lot of your time and it's annoying and you just want to Outsource so you can focus on the business but until you are talented yourself you are you have no right to hire Talent okay you need to be able to close at at least 25 30% and you need to have yourself done hundreds if not thousands of calls yourself I did nearly 2,000 sales calls before I hired my first sales rep and if you've just done a couple of 100 you know you're not good enough to manage because this is the thing is like when you bring a rep on they need they you need to be able to teach them and you need to be able to give them a proven process and you need to be able to give them um Cor recordings and stuff because you know if you're still starting out the beginning then you're not in a position to hire experience which means that you know the person who you're hiring or the people you're hiring they have to be able to lean on you and your experience if you if you you know if you think you're going to hire a rep who's been selling for 10 years they put their 10,000 hours in they've got you know multi7 figures in commission like and you're just there with like your your little you know 5 grand product and you can't even close it yourself like that person will not work for you but but the person who will work for you is the person who you know is still starting out quite ambitious quite hungry but they need to be trained and they need to be managed and they need to be helped they need to be handled and they need to be helped and if you can't close consistently then you do not qualify to teach someone to close consistently and sadly for most of you watching this video you're going to fall into the teaching Camp so the first few reps that I hired had never sold before they were incredibly extroverted Charming hungry people which is kind of what you're looking for and we gave gave them a script and I you know basically had a call with them every single day going through the calls and you know kind of doing this sales management position um and that's basically a very important thing to know so the question then becomes like okay well you know what do I need to say in the posts or what do I email the list or you know what do I tell my clients or my friends um well this is pretty straightforward and um I can I can show because I've actually got on my computer of what we're looking for so First Step surface area but obviously you need to know kind of what to send so second is messaging so basically what you want to do is you want to draft a message now if you're sending um messages to friends or like on WhatsApp or you're you know trying to blast out like just a quick message to someone to see if they know anyone then really all we're doing is we basically say I'm hiring and then blank you know and then what we're doing is we're putting um looking for blank blank blank okay so you state three things that you're looking for adjectives to describe people so you know really it's it's going to be extroverts confidence you know and um like charm or um you can put experience maybe right but basically when when you reach out to people or when you when you send this message to social media or whatever like people need to be able to resonate with these words here or like you know if I said to you do you know I'm looking for a sales rep they need to be extroverted confident and have just a small bit of experience do you know anyone when you when you give them a couple of adjectives it makes it makes categorizing people that they know way easier and they'll be like oh yeah I know someone like that yeah I can introduce you to them but if you just say I'm looking for sales reps do you know anyone well that person who you're talking to might have no idea as to what would make a good rep but when you say what you're looking for specifically and they do now third to this um we put we put compensation and basically what you want to do for compensation is give a range and really it should be 10 to 20K per month now this once again comes back to the your question of like well how do I know if a sales rep can make 10K 20K a month well it should be pretty straightforward because you should only be looking to higher sales reps once you have the appointment volume to support them so if you're trying to hire a sales rep but you cannot fully book them you are not ready to hire sales reps and what I mean by this is you should be doing all the closing right now okay so this is you and your calendar should be you know full you you're fully booked and you have the capacity to book another calendar all the way out and then you're going to hire another rep and you guys are going to you guys going to close in parallel what you must not do is have a full calendar yourself and then try and give that full calendar to a brand new rep and just cross your fingers that it works because if you do this and they do not perform your entire business fails and you will make no money so the only time that you need to hire a rep and the only time that it makes sense to hire rep is when you have figured out a how to sell yourself and B how to fill your Calender and C you must have the option to be able to fill a new calendar at at least 75% capacity in conjunction with your own so we never just like when we on board the first rep or a new rep we never stop selling ourselves until we've got like two three reps that are consistent then we take ourselves off the calendar okay so yeah pretty straightforward this is why like you know if if you if you have a product that works a appointment booking system that works so you can fill their calendar and you have um a script that works works as proven by yourself now you have proof of concept which means that a rep can actually make six figures with you okay but if you have a inconsistent appointment booking solution if your product doesn't really work and gets lots of refund requests and you don't know how to sell yourself I'm telling you even if you find like Jordan bfor or Grant Cardone or the most elite like I don't not that they're the most elite sales people in the world but you know you get my point even if you find the most elite sales person the world it won't work so this all comes back to this environment thing and you need to be ready and prepared for the rep before you know it's kind of probably like f finding a girlfriend like let's say that you want a gorgeous 10 out of 10 super model right it's like well if you're not wealthy and successful and charming and funny and you've got some stuff going for you like they're not going to be interested in you they're just not right and so yeah little wi allery but basic basically this is how you do the hiring post is you're looking for sales reps this is specifically what I'm looking for and I'm looking to compensate at this level okay now what we do in our hiring process now is we get a little bit pickier so you know we basically say provide and then we we say call recordings you know we need call recordings like experience so you know I'm now only hiring people that have closed like over a million dollar um over a million dollars in high tiet transactions in cash okay and I'm only interested in hiring people that can send me like 100 one cool closes with you know their their their spreadsheets and everything but you're probably not going to have this luxury yet because you know for you if if you're if you're still starting out and you're still just trying to get your first rep you can look for experience and you can you can demand it and that's great but honestly like once again it comes back to these a players these killers like they will only work for you if the environment is is able for for a killer on a player and you know just just having like you know a few calls a day and like it won't work so that's the messaging it really is just I'm hiring sales reps I'm looking for people who are extroverted confident and have a little experience in sales um and that's it and then you know you just explain what you're going to compensate them which will be 10 to 20K a month and um that's pretty much straightforward and so what we're looking to do is we're looking to send this message to as many people as possible and we're looking to just expand this surface area and do it on socials do it on email list do it on YouTube Community do it on Instagram do it on Tik Tok do it on Twitter like bang and so what we need to do to do this is we need to have a Google form because when you when you when you send this message to people obviously you're going to have a link and it needs to link to a Google form okay and the Google form is pretty straightforward and what I will actually do is I will bring up my Google form obviously uh here are the questions so on the form you you ask for their name okay and obviously email and number so you can contact them right pretty straightforward um now next thing is very important so second thing is um location so where are you based because you need to think about your Market where you're booking your appointments from what country you know what time zones people are in etc etc um then the next thing is um like how did you find the application because we want to get like a little bit of feedback from you know where these people have got and then the next thing is all we do all we do is we ask them to make a loom um so we don't we don't have an extensive form what we do instead is we ask them to record a loom video and then we put all of the questions in that we would typically ask on on the form instead the reason we do this is because it you can you can tell once you get even even with a little bit of experience under your Bel like you can tell Within probably three seconds of a loom if someone's going to be good at sales or not because think about it like you know if if this person's applying for sales role what we want is we want them to we want them to be like completely energetic and like opening the loom like Charlie I'm so glad to be recording this loom for you I'm going to crush it for you but if they open the loom and they're like hey so yeah I'm just submitting this application like that's how they're going to be on cuse so how they recall the loom for you is how they're going to record the loom for your prospects and how they're going to show up on Zoom calls and stuff so we we need to get them to do a loom because you're going to be doing interviews here and interviewing people and the last thing you want is to be talking to people that don't have energy and you could be wasting your time so on the loom um there's quite a few questions that we we ask so current situation or current job SLR so explain why you're currently working um and then time in roll and why leaving so like you know we asked them like you know why how long have you been doing the job you have now for and you know why are you thinking about leaving and moving towards you know us for example um current income it's really important to know like how much they making um next thing is huge which is can they do fulltime so if they cannot do fulltime do do not hire them because so only really like sales is a tough game and it only really works if someone is completely focused and completely locked in and if sales is the only anything they do okay so needs to be that um e is time zone so you know where you're actually based and and where you from and then I'll just read the rest of these out because we're going to run out of space um the next question is why do you feel like this would why do you feel like you would fit this company specifically so you know what we're looking for here is just a little bit of research a little bit of understanding as to brand that you have the products you have the solution the clients Etc just to show they've actually done some diligence because you know if someone just says oh I think I'd fit in because I fit in anywhere it's like you haven't really you you don't really care about this application um next question is do you have any relevant High ticket sales experience so you know you ask them to explain what have you sold how much have you sold etc etc and then the next one and this is quite a big one and we will use this we we lean on this quite heavily which is have you ever invested in sales education before the reason we asked this question the form is because how curious someone is about their profession or their career a pretty good indicator of that is if they're willing to actually make financial investments in themselves and so we ask we ask about that and then we will specifically ask them like who have you learned from and what did you learn from it because not all sales trainers online are born equally right some of them suck so we know the ones that suck and if someone says that they've bought this person's training then they probably suck because the training sucks and people are only as good as their Mentor or their trainer right so you know if they invested in like a sucky one then we don't hire them the next question is and this is specific to our market so we say do you have any relevant coaching consulting or agency market experience so you would you would obviously insert your Niche or you know who you serve here and then we put in Brackets after this question this is not essential but it's good to know and this is because you don't want to discourage them from booking because they haven't got experience specifically in your Market but this is just a good way to gauge you know does this person understand the language the lingo it's not a deal breaker but it's going to help them and then the next the next question the last question and this is really really this is probably one of the most important questions on there is what are you looking to earn from this role per month to see if we align because you know you should have a rough well you might not but you will after this video right you'll have a rough idea as to what commission you're going to pay reps and like how much money they can make and stuff like that and the the biggest uh cause or leading reason as to why reps will leave and quit and end their contract with you early is because what they're making after a few months is not in alignment with what they thought they would be making and so if this person has been sold the dream by one of these high ticket remote closure emies and you know they're like I want to make 25k a month in the next three months it's very unlikely that your business is going to be able to support that level of you know um that level of desire and so you just kind of want to know and then if you if you think they're a fit and you interview them you just need to set their expectations like hey man look you know I'm going to give you you know 100 calls a month and you know my show rate is 60% so you're going to be conducting 60% and you know my close rate's 30% so maybe you can convert it 20% and this is how much we charge and this is the commission so you're probably going to make more like you know 12K a month which is half of what you said you want to how do you feel about that and then that person will tell you like Oh well man look the the job I'm in right now pays me like 25 so it's not effect you know whatever um and then the last question on the form which is not relevant to the loom but the last question on the form is who if anyone referred you to this form okay pretty straightforward and that that Loom thing is all one question on the form so I'll just go back through it current role how long have you been in the role why you're looking to leave current income fulltime can you take cool full time time zone why do you feel like you'd fit this company specifically um relevant how to get sales experience have you ever invested in sales education before do you have relevant market experience and what are you looking to earn per month all of that is in one like question box if that makes sense and yeah it's really really important that you ask them all and it's important that you get them to just send alone and what what we're looking for here really when it comes to and I'll just bring myself back to the screen here what we're looking for here is on the loom is you're really looking for a couple of things okay you're looking for one energy on the loom you're looking for two charisma you're looking for three effort and you're looking for four conciseness okay so really if you ask yourself like and also five conviction okay if you ask yourself what are the things that you want a sales rep to have on a call with a prospect it's you want them to have energy you know you want them to sort of be pumped up to have like you know something about them to have like a nice air of enthusiasm you want them to have Charisma which means that somewhat Charming or you know they make you feel good just by watching the loom you sort of leave the loom thinking damn I like I like that person like likeability um effort so like have they actually made an effort with this Loom like you know we've had this before where people just record like selfie videos in like Dungeons or some like that you know like have they actually showed up are they are they well presented have they got like a decent microphone is their webcam like in 144p you know have they made an effort to make sure they're Pres able and have they actually done research and like the best people who who do this is they copy and paste the questions they get like a Google doc and then they'll like explain each question and it's like you can just see if someone's put effort in or if someone's just done the application in like 2 minutes right like you know a big indicator of this is if they're reading the questions out as they record the loom they've got the Google form open and now like they kind of they haven't really prepared any answers if that makes sense um the next one is conciseness so you know you don't want like the loom shouldn't really be any more than like 5 10 minutes long um you don't want someone that records like a 45 minute Loom because you might think that oh well that that indicates they've put a lot of effort in but usually it's just because they ramble and they're not concise and if someone's a rambler and they just talk and talk and I know I I know I'm a bit of a bit of a hypocrite on this right you can forgive me but if this person just talks and talks and talks and talks that's how they're going to treat prospects on zoom and we all know that in the sales scenario the less you you say the better the more concise the fewer words you say the more effect you have right and then last but not least is conviction and this is basically just you know we can also call this confidence um but this is kind of just like do you leave the loom with this feeling like oh this person's going to crush because you know what what they need to do really on this Loom is essentially sell you on themselves and their abilities and you know the best reps I've ever hired from this Loom process are the rep to start the start the video and they say hey Charlie how's it going first of all I want you to say that I am so so grateful that you taken the time to review this application and I have so much confidence this is the perfect fit I am going to I will not sleep until I get your results I'm going to crush it for you I'm so excited to get start let me explain these question like if if someone like if someone has that if they just have oh sorry I'm just kicking kicking my bin around over there just going to move out the way don't know if you can hear that or not just is like a it's on the floor keeps dragging across anyway um if that if someone has that like raw conviction that confidence this is kind of like the main thing because everything else like because it kind of comes into energy and Charisma right but even I I will take if someone has no market experience and they have no high ticket experience whatsoever like the conviction the confidence thing you cannot train and so you know the last thing you want is to open the loom and you know for someone to to be like hey Charlie so welcome to my loom video and you know you want them to have this just this there's something about them it's like you know my sales manager brona calls this like they've got the dog in them they've got this like something about them right so really the way that you judge the Looms and the way that you judge whether or not you should interview someone which is the next step we'll talk about in a second is basically how you feel and how much confidence you have in them as a result of watching the loom because you know sales like we know is a transfer of emotion and if you feel a positive emotion or you feel you know positively emotionally drawn to this person then you should interview them because the energy that you got from them on the loom and the feeling you got of them on the loom is the energy they're going to give to your prospect and really like first principle really is just a transfer of emotion um everything else can be trained now what you want to have as a rule of thumb is before you start because this the next stage is interviews and I'm just going to move these up here okay so next stage is interviews and basically what you want to do here is before you do any interviews or before you know you make any decisions is you really want to try and get like 30 to 100 forms okay if anything I'm even going to say like 50 to a 100 because what's going to happen with these looms is most of them are going to suck but if you don't know what good looks like then you don't have any idea as to you know what's good and what's bad so the way I'm going to explain this is is pretty straightforward the more people you talk to the higher likelihood or the higher chance you have of finding someone that's good and that's pretty that's pretty straightforward right but the only way that you know what bad looks like is when you know what good looks like and so if you get 15 Google forms and they all suck then what you're going to do is you're going to pick the best the best Loom or the best form from that pool of 15 but the thing is is that just because someone sucks less than everybody else doesn't mean they're good and so you know when we make a higher we will literally not like we know what we're looking for right but if you haven't done this many times before like you can fall into a real trap because let's say that you watch 15 looms and the first 14 are kind of just subpar and then the 15th is just like okay like let's say the first 14 are Dreadful like they're just really bad and then the 15th is like kind of all right like you will think that the 15th person is like this gift sent from God it's like oh my God this person's amazing but they're only amazing in contrast to the people that you've seen before so the biggest like the biggest hiring mistake and the most dangerous Hing mistake is not having enough contrast and not having enough comparison or enough units of comparison to what's good and what's bad and basically the the more looms that you get and the more looms that you want watch the higher the likelihood you see someone that's actually talented and actually good and then you can be like oh damn like you watch the first 14 they will suck you watch the 15th they're all right but you think they're amazing because you know they don't suck but then you watch the 16th and that person could be like five times better you know than the number 15 so yeah that's pretty important we want at least 50 to a hundred of these um of of of these Google forms before you make any any sort of interview approaches and really you know we we want to try and have like I would I would honestly make the argument you want to have like 10 to 30 interviews to hire a rep um it's the same premise right because you know it's you know if you have 50 forms 100 forms you know you're probably only going to get like 20% of them are going to be any good so yeah we really want to have like 10 to 20 interviews 30 interviews 30 is a little extreme but you need at least 10 interviews before you make a highend decision for full stop a lot of people what they will do when they're hiring reps is they're so eager and desperate and they're in so much pain to just Outsource this sales thing that they H they they interview like three people and then they just pick the best of the three and that doesn't make any sense because you know most people suck and so you want to do at least 10 because the chances of at least one of them being good is is is acceptable right so the interview process is is pretty straightforward and I'm just going to P it up on my screen here because we have our internal interviewing process that I'm going to BAS this around and sort of walk you through if that makes sense so couple of points that you're looking for okay you can write these down on your notepad um so first of all you before the call if they have any past experience and they've they've they've provided evidence or anything like that you want to do a little bit of diligence on them so you know if they say where they've worked then you know call up that business and you know actually don't do that if they still have the job do not do that because they might the the the business might not know that leaving yet but like you know if they sent you call recordings if they say they've worked somewhere just do a little bit of research do a little bit homework um now next thing is on this interview one of the main things that you're looking to do and we have this on our internal Sales Management notes here is you need to discover their motivation so why do they want to make money why do they want to be a high ticket sales rep why do they want to make the money they want to make this could be Financial Freedom it could be like taking care of their family it could be they want to travel it could just they have a really deep interest in the industry they may want to buy like a car or something in my experience like the Reps that want freedom are incredibly dangerous to hire like the Reps that this sort of remote closer archetype like you know the people that are like yeah so like you know I'm in high ticket sales because I want to be able to make money online and I want to be able to be in like Brazil one day and then Bono the next day and then I want to be in like Mexico and now I want to be in like South America like people the Reps that want to constantly move around are terrible like they suck they really do because you know think about yourself and your work when have you ever been productive abroad it's very hard right so you want to watch out for that motivation and you really do not want to hire anyone that wants to move around and travel around the rest of the motivations are fine but you kind of need to get to the bottom of them um few more things so very important so you're going to ask them questions and you're going to make statements and one thing that you're looking for in this interview is and you're not asking this as a question it's just something that you're doing as a as an interviewee is can they listen to you and answer your questions succinctly and do they get off track easily so you know can they hold like a a concise focused conversation or not and what this means is if you ask them a question you know and the f i I'll walk you through what questions to ask in just a second here but if you ask them a question on the interview do they do they it's like kind of like bowling you know like how you have the barriers up like do they stay within the lines of the question question or do they go off on like a 20 minute Rampage about something completely irrelevant and then like if the biggest red flag in an interview is when a person will ask sorry what was the question so they go off on this weird tangent and then they have to come back and ask you what the question was that if they do that on the interview they're going to do it on sales calls which means that like they're going to end up over talking they're going to overshare they're not going to keep a concise line of questioning n um next thing is um are they interested in the nuances of the calls and the industry so are they interested in details do they ask lots of questions about the industry or do they just want to understand the process at like a really surface level big big big important thing is you want detail um the next thing really important is how coachable are they so you know you want to you want to get an indication of like do they repeatedly tell they're open to coaching um do they because this is the thing is like a lot of these new reps a lot of these fresh reps that have been through like a sales trainer or something they think they're good but they're really not and you know a lot of them think they don't need any more coaching because they they think education is this weird one time Affair the thing is is like you have a proven process for your sales like conversion rep and you know what works and you know your industry and you've built a process that works and the the only thing that would stop the rep from not succeeding is if they failed to follow the process and so what we're looking to do on these interviews is get an indication of is this person coachable are they going to listen to feedback are they willing to change the way they sell to fit the market and the product right um this next thing says well this is this is what our sales managers made ask questions about their perspective on a topic or attribute and then ask for an example of how they've demonstrated that in the past what do they say and what do they do do they actually match so anytime that you ask someone for something about themselves you need to ask them like give me an example so you know if you say like you know are you like do you love sales you know you know it's like yeah they'll say yeah I love sales it's my favorite thing it's like okay well like what what's something that you've done in your life to show that you love it and you know if if someone says well you know you know when I was like when the reason I love sales is because my dad worked in sales and you know when I was 10 like he would take me to like some of his client houses and like I would sit down and watch the clothes and you know my favorite movie of all time is wol of Wall Street and like I've even got pictures of like the best sales people in the world on my bedroom like obviously it's not going to get that far right but you want to you need to look like do their actions match their words or are they just saying these things because they think they should which is almost always what happens so you need to be careful about that and then the last thing you're looking for is is do they turn up presentable and well-dressed you know are they is the are they are they taking the interview on their iPhone and it's all shaky you know if they put on a shirt or a c or cge shirt or something you know semi- formal is their background tidy another thing that I like to do is at some point throughout the interview I'll try and ask them to share their screen because what that will do is like you can tell a lot about someone from the state of their desktop right and so like do they have like a million tabs open is everything chaotic and messy like if it is they it's not going to be a deal breaker it's not going to be the end of the world but if they're not organized in their own personal digital environment then organizing like a hundred calls a month and crms and follow-ups like there needs a little of work so let me explain a few questions that I would ask um on on on this so obviously you know from from the interview perspective you know we have the small talk to begin with right pretty straightforward I'm just going to make myself bigger here so we start with the small talk okay and we we we're going to get into that like where are you from like how are you doing where are you calling from all right let's jump in and get started and then what we do is the first question we ask is we say okay Mr JY or Mr Mr sales RP what I'd like you to do is basically tell me your life story from start to finish please and this throws them into a pit of chaos because what this does is the reason you ask this question is because it immediately shows you how how like can they think on the spot in terms of like you know can can they like do they Panic or whatever but it shows you how they organize their thinking and it's a really good way to understand how quick and sharp and smart someone is is if you ask them that question and they panic and they're like well but if they say really good question um yeah okay no worries and then they bang they're straight into it or like and then what you're looking for is how long does it take them to answer the question because this is one of these open-ended questions that someone could literally spend the entire interview answering and if they do that then they're not going to be a good sales rep but you if they get it done in like 3 minutes okay well and you can sort of see them building these bullet points and this mind map and then they like okay I got it and then they deliver it and they've got confidence and the people that really Crush they they link they start linking things back to why it would make them good for the role so one of the best reps we ever hire like he he he answered this question and he talked about how like you know he went to University and he studied architecture and stuff like that and he said like yeah well I did architecture um and you know one of the things that I found was really good about architecture is it taught me how to you know it taught me how to really think about design and it taught me how to be cre cretive and I think that's something that I really carry through into my sales experience and my sales calls because you know it it allows me to have this very unique perspective about creativity and you know getting creative with scripts and stuff and I was like that's a sales person right there because you know it's a little nuanced but pretty good to know so you start with the story question and either this this this will throw them into a pit of chaos or they'll handle it well and they'll crush and so next questions I'm just going to read these out for you so you can you can ask them um so then basically saying like can you share with me what motivated you to apply to work for us um can you tell me about your current job responsibilities and what they include what interests you in potentially doing a different line of work or switching companies that you sell for um what are your interest in our industry specifically so why are you why are you interested in the industry like this this space that I'm working in like what do you know about it have you done some research on it etc etc and a lot of them they won't have any experience or interest in the industry or at least like you know they won't know much about it and if they don't if they then we're calling them out but what we're looking for here is maybe some honesty it's like honesty man like you know I'll be completely honest with you I've never worked in this space before um I don't know much about it I can see how I can see how I could develop an interest for it but I'll be completely honest I don't really know much about it that's fine you know we're not we're not worried about that um and then this is this is a pretty good one this question here is can you give me an example of one of the most challenging problems that you have you've had to face in your current job and how you've had to solve it it's another one of these questions that's very open-ended and puts them in this under this immediate pressure okay and then I'm going to Rattle these off how much if any of experience have you had in sales before and how did process how did the process in selling that work do you have a script you followed what were your results like in that system what was the product and who was your ideal customer for it how are the leads generated how do you describe your listening skills can you give them an example of when you use your listening skills to resolve a difficult situation in your role how comfortable are you working in a commit only position it's very important because we're going to be paying them commission have you ever worked in a commission only position in the past um have you considered starting your own business before because if they have then it's not a fit because they're going to they're just going to keep thinking about that um and have you got any side gigs on right now so can you give this your full-time you know Focus um and what sales books and training programs have you been through and um I like this question so the last question is what's one thing that you believe to be true that everybody else would disagree with you on because this just is like a good indicator of their ability to think critically right some pretty hard-hitting questions in there now once you've asked them all of those questions um all you really doing here next is just describing the company so you know basically you you talk about like well you you know your company right so you're just going to give them a brief sort of you know two to three to four minute pitch and explanation as to what the company is who you serve who you help what the offer is the company history what you want to do in the future etc etc and then all you do is you then ask them what questions they have now a lot of them are going to have questions about how the company works a lot of them are going to have questions about the compensation but you kind of the compensation comes last once they fully understand the company okay so now that's basically the interview process I'm going to talk to you about the compensation briefly here um actually no we'll do this in a second because you can explain the compensation once you understand it so yeah pretty simple um you'll have the conversation discussion you'll have the question discussion and then once you finish the interview you want to set a deadline so what you're going to do is you're going to say to them okay well I'm interviewing you know seven more people this week or 10 more people this week and I'm looking to make this higher specifically on this date and you want to give them oh you can't see my writing on let's move this down here so yeah you want to tell them you're going to look to hire on a specific date um or a specific time because otherwise like they might get weird and freaky and start looking for other jobs and then you've lost them so you give them a specific date and you clear all your interviews and you never make a hire until finish the interview so finish all of them that you've got on the calendar and that's basically that okay now once you've done the um interviews the fifth St stage is obviously the decision right so you know you should have at least 10 candidates that you've interviewed and you should have all the calls recorded in a spreadsheet with all the questions answered like you need to rewatch the recordings like who did you get a Vib for who did you get fill for and then you make your decision on the date so the next thing is um obviously onboarding and then I'm we're going to talk about incentives decision so you basically you round up all the interviewees you listen to all of the call recordings because you should record the interviews and you know you're going to have if you've done at least 10 you're going to have like one or two people where you're like okay yeah you're not bad you're not bad I'll hire you and this means we need to onboard them so onboarding is very straight for basically you need to set them up with a company email um pretty simple and then really second to that is just training so what you want to do is there's three things that you need to do to give them training properly so you need to give them the script okay you need to give them call recordings and you need to give them a loom that explains the script if that makes sense and really like you need to just say to them look like I've got like you know 51 core closes like I've got this is the script that I use that i' you know been working on um that but works consistently and then you just need to send them alom and then basically like the sales process is really broken down into the discovery um the pitch and the objections okay and so you know what we're looking to do is we're looking to have a loom on how the discovery works and all the intricacies of the discovery we're looking to have a loom on the pitch and how that works the intricacies and then the same thing with objection handling and you know this is the thing if you don't know how to do these then the rep isn't going to perform because even if the rep is good and has some experience like you know you have more experience and you have all the tools they need and if you don't they're not going to close properly okay so um next to this um is that's pretty much it to be honest you need to get them on the calendar but what I would do is you really want them to do training for one to two weeks before you bring them on the calendar and when you bring them on a calendar is you start them at the beginning on a half cow and what this means is you start them on a half calendar so you don't just bring them on and start feeding them like eight calls a day immediately you bring them on and give them like three four calls a day and your objective here is to try and have them to conduct like two to three calls a day for the first week okay so really like you know you really want to get like 15 to like maybe like 20 calls Max honestly like you want to try and get them to do like 10 to 15 calls in the first week and what you're going to do is you're going to listen to all of these calls and you're going to make a decision on whether to keep them now in the first month we're not concerned about their closing we're not concerned about their close rate we're not concerned about whether they're collecting cash we're not concerned about if they're getting deals over the line at all none of that matters at all in the first month all we're looking to do in these in these first couple of weeks the first 10 20 30 calls is are they following the process and are they coachable I don't care if we hire rep and they don't close in the first couple weeks we're not we don't worry we're not worried about that at all all we're worried about is when we're listening to the Calles that they've conducted is like are they are they trying to are they following the process or are they trying to do it their own way because if you think about it critically it's really simple like if if you have a process that works and converts that you know converts and you have a script that works that you follow that works in theory all the rep has to do is follow it okay now yeah there's some intricacies around objection handling and training and stuff but if they know how to do this and they have the humility to follow it and try that's it so first week you will know if they're following the process or not and a week in if if they're not listening at all if it's apparent they haven't paid attention to the script if it's apparent they haven't watched the Looms like you want someone that comes in and watches your looms and the core like a 100 times over you know if they haven't watched the call recordings and you know that it's clear their Market understanding hasn't improved then we then we have to fire them and do the interviewing process again and find somebody else now one thing that you can do when you hire people and we will do this um quite a lot after the interview stage is we'll actually bring on two reps and you know what we'll do is we'll put them both on half calendars and we'll make a decision after two weeks to cut one and the one that gets cut is the one that's following the process the least if that makes sense this way you kind of guarantee that the high is actually going to be be good and happens because you'd be surprised how many people you bring on thinking they're going to crush only to find out they can't even follow a script right eventually you'll get good at this to the point where you can you can just hire someone and they'll just Crush immediately because you've done it so much but that happens only once you've hired like 10 15 sales reps so in the beginning you know maybe bring on two people at once give them half calendars maybe they they only need to conduct like you know five six seven calls in the first week for you to know if they're going to work out or not right so that's the on board it's really simple very straightforward and we leave them on like the half calendar and then only once like once they get their first deal or a couple of deals in and once that process is like really dialed in then we bring them into the full calendar then we start spending more money to fill their calendars okay and then eventually you can offboard yourself now the next thing is incentives and this is the last thing we're going to talk about now there's obviously there's tons of stuff that I can talk about here in terms of Sales Management in terms of using leaderboards you know bonuses um there's there's a lot to get into but you know I want this to be uh just a more Simple Guide for hiring a rep because you only need to really concern yourself with Sales Management and Sales Management systems and you know tracking systems and all this stuff once you've got like you know four or five reps then then you actually got a team if you've got like one or two guys or you're looking to hire and like another person you haven't got a team yet management isn't that necessary and management becomes a necessity when you have like five six reps right so in incentives how does this work how do we pay them well obviously we pay them commission only never pay them a salary or a base okay because if you if you pay them a salary or base you're just going to create comfort and anyone that doesn't like I can tell you this Killers a player sales reps they want to work on commission only if someone comes in and says they want a salary that is the biggest red flag ever because think about it it's a statement of Doubt like you know if someone's like yeah I want like a I I'm not going to work for commission only I want a salary what they've just communicated to you non-verbally or indirectly is I don't really have any confidence in my ability to make money closing so I'm just going to ask you for a salary so commission only now what we do is we start every rep that comes on board at 10% Commission of cash collected okay and what this means if let's say that our program is let's say that we sell a $20,000 thing okay and let's say that you know we we a 10-month payment plan which means that you know people pay $2,000 a month then what will happen is the rep will get 10% of this for every month as long as the cash collects it's really important that you only pay them on cash collection because if they sell a payment plan or a split pay and you pay them Commission on money that hasn't collected yet you're in dark deep trouble okay so cash collected now one thing that we do is for every year every one year that a rep stays with us us we increase their commission by 1% and we cap this out at 15% so I've got a rep I started my company four years ago and I've got a rep that's been with me basically 3 years and that person is now on 14% commission okay but the new rep will come in and be on 10% and so what we're looking to do is it's a retention strategy we're looking to basically you know keep them on board and for every year of loyal service we increase by by 1% now 15% is nuts it's insane but the reason that we do this and the reason that we incentivize and increase it over time is purely because like if I've trained someone for 2 three years I want to keep them because I'd rather have someone who has three years of experience in the company in the industry in the culture with the cuse with the pipeline with the account management with the client results like that person I would rather have at I'd rather have every rep at 15% if they've been with us for three years than than 10% okay and so that's that's pretty simple that's that's how you commission them and that's how you you know pay them out now if you aren't charging much money this is why you have to charge High ticket prices this is why sales reps only really work in this High ticket space at least you know from a high perspective because if you're charging $2,000 for your course and you try and hire a sales rep like they're only going to get $200 a sale and you know that means they they're going to need like like what like you know even if they make 10 sales a month that's only like two grand right so you know even if they make 20 Sal a month it's for Grand it's not really much it's not really enough to to motivate and incentivize them okay so there's more there's more leverage if you want them to if you want them to get paid more increase your price not your conversion rates or sorry not your um commission rates that's how you pay them now what we will also do is we will bonus them bonus on UCC so UC UCC stands for upfront cash Collective okay so what you want to do is basically bonus minimum standard it's kind of the same thing well it's not actually we basically want to manage them and incentivize them with the carrot and the stick and I'll explain the carrot first the carrot is basically if they hit a certain amount of cash then they will receive a bonus so for our team if a sales rep goes above $90,000 in cash in a month then they can receive a bonus of up to $7,500 the caveat is they have to be the highest performing sales rep in that month so they have to out compete everybody else so you might want to do this where if they collect like you know you should know this from your numbers so you should know how much cash you've been collection collecting each month and you want to just put it slightly above that and if they collect that then you can come up with a appropriate you know bonus it could be 5% of the cash collected it could be 10% of the cash collected um but this is just this is only on upfront cash collection now the thing that is usually way more motivating and the thing that you must have for your reps is a minimum standard it is huge so what you do is really there's three things that you can measure sales reps on right let me just move this up here okay you can measure them on units you can measure them on cach and you can measure them on conversion rate and you might be thinking like okay well which one's the most important thing a lot of people think that conversion rates the most important a lot of people think unit is most important lot people think cash is most important the truth is all three of them are weighted equally so what we have in our company is we mandate a minimum of every single month the rep has to get 12 units they have to get 45k in cash upfront cash collected and they have to convert it 15% if a rep does not hit this then they enter the danger zone for next month so the way that this works is basically um let's say that it's January and let's say in January they only get they get 10 units they get 45k cash but they get a 10% conversion rate now they are you know they messed up here and they messed up here so what that means is for February if they do not hit the minimum standard then they're fired and this sounds brutal but it works so what this does is if if you try and incentivize only on units then you get no cash if you try and incentivize on cash then you get no units and if you try and incentivize purely on sales conversion rate then the Reps start getting weird they start over qualifying they start taking less calls because they want to conserve their energy you need to you need to have a minimum standard on all three of these things and you know so basically what this does is it puts the Reps in under this constant pressure to perform and that's kind of what you want and then you also have the bonuses so that they're motivated to you know push and push and push but I've engineered my Sales Management incentives and minimum and standards to basically be that if every rep does this then I get a 2 to 2.5 to 3x return on investment on them and every single rep you have should essentially be a money doubling or money tripling machine um which is where you know for my reps for example for me to fill their calendars it costs me uh about $30,000 a month okay no it's more than that actually it's like $35,000 to $337,000 a month but every rep that I have when after I've collected lifetime value revenue from all my customers I will make about 100 Grand back so you know I have a 2.2 to 2.3x return on every single sales rep for as long as they hit these minimum standards and that's kind of how you want to engineer your sales team and your Sales Management expectations is there needs to be at least a 2X return because that allows you to scale it you know 40 to 50% profit margin and you know right now we're we're at eight figures basically like 800k 900k a million a month with you know8 to n to 10 reps at any given time and you know we can we can spend you know know 300K on ads and we might make 600k back from Those ads and another 200k from organic appointments so yeah that that's how you need to pay them basically and and that's kind of like in a nutshell how to hire sales reps um it's it's not it's a difficult thing but once you've done it once you find one it gets it's finding that one person that that makes a difference and for me it took me like five six hires before I found someone that was actually competent and capable so don't ship do not think that you can do not try and get off the cuse yourself do not try and like you know Outsource sales is this like thing just close alongside them until they're closing consistently bring in a second rep to replace you once they're closing consistently get yourself off the calendar it's going to take you you know four five six months maybe even a year to find someone that's good but once you find that first rep now you know what to look for and now you've got more core recordings you've got more confidence it's just about that first Domino so that's basically how to higher sales reps I hope you found it helpful if you need help getting clients there's a link in the description you can click it's a funnel it's a sales page it's my client acquisition program that teaches stuff like this in way more detail I don't care if you check it out or not but it might help you have a wonderful day take care bye-bye
